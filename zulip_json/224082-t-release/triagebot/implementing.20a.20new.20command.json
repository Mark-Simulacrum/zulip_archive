Triagebot would track in its database what issues/PRs are blocked on what other issues/PRs and would comment and remove the S-blocked label when the block ended due to closure or merge.</p>\n<p>Could someone give me some general advice on how this should be implemented? I'm guessing I would a handler to <code>src/handlers/*.rs</code>, but I figured it would be a good idea to get some advice before I went ahead and implemented it.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
