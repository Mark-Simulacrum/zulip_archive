We think something that is active and implemented in rust itself would be good, and recommend zola (<a href=\"https://www.getzola.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.getzola.org/\">https://www.getzola.org/</a>) (<a href=\"https://github.com/getzola/zola\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/getzola/zola\">https://github.com/getzola/zola</a>) </p>\n<p>2) In particular, just to get Fede moving along, this theme looks nice: <a href=\"https://zola-even.netlify.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://zola-even.netlify.com/\">https://zola-even.netlify.com/</a></p>\n<p>3) Fede's plan is to implement the scripts and temporarily host is somewhere where the rendered version can be reviewed, prior to merging and having whoever handles the particulars  incorporate the scripts to infra CI. Comments?</p>",
