As we create more content through lecture series, working group overviews, rustc component deep-dives, we might want better organization of these on Youtube as well. By that I mean, people should be able to find all the related videos to one topic right from within youtube. Currently for the closure, they are scattered all over the place and difficult to locate on Youtube. One way would be through playlist as some wg are already doing. Maybe we can have a rustc-internals channel and then have related videos grouped together in playlists ? thoughts ?</p>",
