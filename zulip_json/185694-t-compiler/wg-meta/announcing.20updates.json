I feel like we need better visibility for the summaries and activities of the various compiler working groups. I was envisioning that it would be nice to have a central blog that just contains these sorts of updates and announcements -- basically, the <strong>activity</strong> of each of the working groups. In fact, I suspect that the blog should be <strong>project wide</strong>, with the ability to filter by team, by working group, or by other things. </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://readrust.net\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://readrust.net\">readrust.net</a> author encouraged me to write-up an issue with more details. Before doing that, I thought I would open up some discussion here.</p>\n<p>I've also been wondering about the structure of the weekly meetings -- I was thinking that maybe, instead of <strong>pulling</strong> from the groups, each group should <strong>push</strong> updates, content, and questions, and we can review them in the triage meeting. </p>\n<p>Originally, I had in mind that we would go round robin because I thought it'd be useful to be able to see if working groups haven't been active with updates in a while. But we can do that separately just by having the updates organized by working group and checking for working groups that haven't posted any comments in a while (or, honestly, just monitoring Zulip). This could be a signal to go check-in and see how things are going and if we can do anything to help.</p>\n<p>I'd also maybe like to cc some more folks to get more input, but I'll just start with posting a comment here I think. =)</p>",
