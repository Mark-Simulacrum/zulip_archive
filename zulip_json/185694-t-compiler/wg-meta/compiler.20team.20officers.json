In other organizations I'm involved in, I can definitely say that knowing that \"I am the treasurer\" (or whatever) both helps me to define a kind of upper and low bar for how much work I have to do. i.e., if I do my treasurer duties, I am doing a good job. If I fail to do them, I'm slacking off. If I do other stuff, that's great, but not required.</p>",
