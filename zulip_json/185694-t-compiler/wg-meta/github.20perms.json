The problem is that one can only add org members to teams. While there's work happening around creating some sort of \"assign non-org-members to issues\" scheme, the main advantage of team membership that I see is being able to ping groups. We could add a similar workaround where pinging a team will also cause a bot to ping the non-org members directly. All in all I believe this is solvable, but I'm wondering if we should update the docs to reflect this policy.</p>",

Like you said, there are plenty of ways to go about fixing this. For now, updating our documentation to reflect that it's only-kind-of-possible to add people to GitHub groups is probably a good idea.</p>",
