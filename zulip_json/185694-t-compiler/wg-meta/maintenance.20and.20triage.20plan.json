But I don't really have a plan yet. We decided in today's planning meeting to tentatively schedule this for May 31, but we gotta come up with some details. I'm opening this topic to discuss.</p>\n<p>I'm pinging <span class=\"user-group-mention\" data-user-group-id=\"492\">@T-compiler</span> and <span class=\"user-group-mention\" data-user-group-id=\"1095\">@T-compiler/WG-meta</span> to get an idea of folks that may be interested. </p>\n<p>Here are some things I think:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our labels are too coarse; too many thing are P-high</li>\n<li>We could use a more structured plan around getting volunteers. I think it would help to have a set of states that a regression report, for example, goes through:<br>\n    - e.g., does it have a bisection?<br>\n    - does it have a minimal test case?</li>\n<li>We could use issue templates to setup the checklist and make triage easier (e.g., ask people \"Is this code that used to compile but no longer does?\" and then auto-add the relevant tags)</li>\n<li>We could have special labels and try to attract people who are willing to help with bisection and creating narrow test cases.</li>\n</ul>",
