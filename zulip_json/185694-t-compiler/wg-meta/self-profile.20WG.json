Thoughts? I would mainly imagine that we lay out a (brief) roadmap, create a stream, and then check in on in the meetings every once in a while to see how you're doing (not necessarily that it's a big mentoring opportunity, although I wouldn't be surprised if we were able to get a people to hack on things with you that way)</p>",
