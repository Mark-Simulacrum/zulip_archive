The <a href=\"https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/compiler\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/compiler\">compiler-team page on the main website</a> has a list of working groups, but it is out of date. It is generated from the <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/team\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/team\">rust-lang/team</a> repository data. So we need to synchronize our set of working groups from <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team\">rust-lang/compiler-team</a> with that repository. I don't know how we can do that manually. We also should update the <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/blob/master/procedures/form-new-working-group.md\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/blob/master/procedures/form-new-working-group.md\">form new working group procedure</a> to include this step. The \"members\" for these purposes should be the leads, and we should also add a <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/team/blob/5607a994d863cb99cc2a8c514ad4db29b1ea51c6/teams/community.toml#L20\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/team/blob/5607a994d863cb99cc2a8c514ad4db29b1ea51c6/teams/community.toml#L20\">repo link like this one</a> that points to the appropriate working-group directory. (I assume <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"121055\">@Pietro Albini</span> that can be any URL?)</p>",
