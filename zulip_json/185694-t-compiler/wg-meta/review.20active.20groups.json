Several of them are no longer active. I'd also like to maybe talk about reviving some of the proposals we've been discussing about best to organize ourselves (e.g., areas or other such things). But I'm looking a bit for \"minimum viable actions\". I guess a starting point would be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>remove the parallel compilation wg, it's inactie</li>\n<li>remove the PGO wg, it's done</li>\n</ul>\n<p>and maybe work our way through the rest and see if we can clarify charters.</p>",
