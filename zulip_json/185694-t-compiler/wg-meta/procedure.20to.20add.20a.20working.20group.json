Also, I'm sure this text is strange or incomplete, so please feel free to add suggestions. I just thought it'd be nice to have some directions I can point people at as I start to bug them to setup the initial set of working groups.</p>\n<p>Maybe this document (or a similar one) should be created to kind of cover the \"advice for working group leads\" that <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116266\">@Santiago Pastorino</span> was mentioning?</p>",
