The crazy idea was born to emulate the <em>rendering pipeline itself</em> with an interpreter that runs directly on the GPU as a set of monsterous flexible shaders. If we compile these massive shaders on game start, whenever a game configures Flipper/Hollywood to render something, these \"uber shaders\" would <strong>configure themselves</strong> and render it without needing any new shaders. Theoretically, this would solve shader compilation stuttering by avoiding compilation <em>altogether</em>.</p>\n<p>This idea is all kinds of crazy, but it was also the first idea that had the potential to actually solve this impossible problem. The difficulty with this solution instead came from the absurd amount of work and expertise required to even get to the point of trying it. To put it into perspective, even among all the developers that work on Dolphin, only two or three people <em>at most</em> have the necessary knowledge on not only the GameCube/Wii hardware, but also modern GPUs, APIs, <strong>and the drivers</strong> to write, debug, and optimize the shaders. Not to mention running an interpreter as huge shaders is not exactly easy on the GPU, and many were afraid that all that work might not even run full speed on current video cards.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And their writeup on their development / continuous integration architecture made me realize they're a Real Software Engineering Project: <a href=\"https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2015/01/25/making-developers-more-productive-dolphin-development-infrastructure/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2015/01/25/making-developers-more-productive-dolphin-development-infrastructure/\">https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2015/01/25/making-developers-more-productive-dolphin-development-infrastructure/</a></p>",
