IMO, these manpages are likely largely unused by users using rustup (since they won't be in MANPATH by default), but distro users are more likely to stumble across them. So I thought I'd mention this PR here in case <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"138448\">@cuviper</span> has an opinion as our resident distro person :)</p>\n<p>I think I've seen really old manpages on my system even for (presumably) not that old tooling, so I suspect the date in this file is something most people aren't really caring for.</p>",
