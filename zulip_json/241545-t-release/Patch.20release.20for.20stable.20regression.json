It has been fixed in this <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8754\">PR</a> in the current beta.<br>\nI believe the issue is quite serious, given that it means that some users' program will now fail to build. Do you think a backport to the current stable (1.48) would be a good idea?<br>\nThx</p>",
