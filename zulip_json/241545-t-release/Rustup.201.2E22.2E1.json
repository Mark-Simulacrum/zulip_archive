It's a victim of the current pandemic in the sense that the author of <code>env_proxy</code> knew about it, fixed it,  but failed to publish the crate due to the changing times.  I am preparing a 1.22.1 which is 1.22.0 with just their patch to fix that, and I'd really like to push it out today if you have time?</p>",
