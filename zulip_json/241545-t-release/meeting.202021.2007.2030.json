The options I can imagine are: (1.) playbook for writing release updates, that specifically points out one should (at minimum) update RELEASES.md, and after that consider whether section in blog post is also warranted. (Such a playbook might already exist for all I know), (2.) link checking is an interesting idea, but youâ€™re right that its probably not quite right.  But some kind of consistency check between the two could be interesting; e.g. maybe for every section of release blog post, there should exist at least one sentence in the section that corresponds to a RELEASES.md entry? (Do some kind of fuzzy matching of the words to allow for slight deviations.) That may be a bit extreme, I admit.</p>",
