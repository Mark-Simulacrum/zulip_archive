I recently added the llvm-project subdirectory, but it should be a sibling to the <code>library</code> directory.  That is, you should see <code>rust/src/llvm-project</code> and <code>rust/library</code>, and the most relevant stuff is in the <code>library</code> directory.</p>",

Maybe it is somehow confused when both directories exist, but that code appears to do the right thing.
