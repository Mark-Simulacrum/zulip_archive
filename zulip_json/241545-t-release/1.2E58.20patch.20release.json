It's a very low blast radius with viable workarounds, so i don't feel like there's a justification for a patch release _just_ for this, but we'd certainly take advantage of a planned patch if there's other needs for one (i need to make sure our fix gets into 1.59 too)</p>\n<p>for ref: <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt/issues/5080#issuecomment-1013303455\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt/issues/5080#issuecomment-1013303455</a></p>",
