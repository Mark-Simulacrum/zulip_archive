The test in question is failing on a tier-1 builder (aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu tests) so ignoring it is sort of questionable, but I'm currently planning to do so in order to allow us to start testing the beta (crater) and bumping the master bootstrap compiler. The test seems to pass on aarch64 machines when run locally, at least in a simulated configuration, so it's not clear what the cause is.</p>\n<p>If we do ignore it I plan to make that issue p-critical and milestone it at 1.54, but I don't know how much can be done about it.</p>",
