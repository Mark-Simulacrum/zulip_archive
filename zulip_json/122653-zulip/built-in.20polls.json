At this point, you can see the poll and the vote counts on mobile, and add your vote.</p>\n<p>We have some follow-ups remaining to add mobile support for viewing who voted on a poll, editing the poll question and adding options.</p>\n<p>I'd be interested to hear if any of the outstanding issues are deal-breakers for being able to use the native <code>/poll</code> functionality.</p>",
