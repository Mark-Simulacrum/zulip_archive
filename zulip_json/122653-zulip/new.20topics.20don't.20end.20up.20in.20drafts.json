Mention that you're coming from the Rust community.</p>\n<p>As a workaround, you can type some characters in the message field so that it saves it as a draft. It's not as automatic – you can't just click away without thinking about it – but it works well enough. Three characters is the minimum to save a draft; I usually type \"...\" when I'm specifically wanting to save only the topic for now.</p>",
