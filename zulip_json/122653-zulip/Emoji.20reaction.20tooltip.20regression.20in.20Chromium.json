I move the mouse to hover over the button but <em>nothing</em> is shown up. It works fine in Firefox. Does anyone else have this issue? It worked for a while even after the <a href=\"#narrow/stream/122653-zulip/topic/did.20zulip.20update.20today.3F\">Zulip update</a>, so that's not the cause.<br>\nAlso, I remembered a related issue: Chromium also won't show the reaction list on GitHub if the mouse is hovered over the emoji button, unless I log in and (right) click it. The same works fine in Firefox too, but this is a consistent issue for me, not started to happen a few days ago.</p>",
