It's infuriating, and never used to happen.  I've turned off press enter to send, hopefully that fixes it, maybe if I can also train myself not to do <code>shift + enter</code> for the newlines too.</p>\n<p>I'm just venting, but god it sucks. I'm on macos and latest firefox nightly. I don't really think its related to the browser, though, but maybe.</p>",
