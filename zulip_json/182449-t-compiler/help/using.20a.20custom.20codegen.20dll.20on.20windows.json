I added the target dir to PATH, that did not work, i added it to an existing folder in PATH, that still did not work. I also tried using relative paths but that did not work either. Does rustc expect something else? im giving it the full path to my dll and its telling <code>The specified module could not be found. (os error 126)</code> :(</p>",
