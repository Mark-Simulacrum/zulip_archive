Are there any other resources besides   <a href=\"https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/about-this-guide.html\" title=\"https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/about-this-guide.html\">https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/about-this-guide.html</a> that I should consider learning from, perhaps I should be reading a general compilers book? Thx :)</p>",
