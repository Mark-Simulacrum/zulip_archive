In the implementation of the Clone trait for Vec[T],  the \"clone\" fn is like:<br>\nfn clone(&amp;self) -&gt; Vec[T] {<br>\n  &lt;[T]&gt;::to_vec(&amp;**self)<br>\n}<br>\nIn my understanding, self here is a reference. *self is still a reference to Vec[T], and **self is also a reference to Vec[T] because Deref for &amp;T returns &amp;T. Why are there 2 deref?</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
