I'm using a run-make test, and I'm getting unexpected results from the test: it compiles and links successfully, but it produces unexpected output.  I'd like to inspect the resulting .exe file (I'm on Windows), but the test harness deletes it on exit.  Is there a flag I can pass to <code>x.py test</code> to ask the test system to leave the temporary directory intact?</p>\n<p><em>EDIT:</em> never mind (sheepishly).  The problem isn't that the temp directory was getting deleted; I was looking for it in the wrong place.  Sorry for the noise!</p>",
