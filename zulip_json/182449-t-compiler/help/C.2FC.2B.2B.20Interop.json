You may find more help in other venues such as the Rust community discord: <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/rust-lang-community\">https://discord.com/invite/rust-lang-community</a> .</p>\n<p>However, to answer your question to the best of my ability, you cannot directly interop with rust programs compiled to llvm bitcode as Rust has no stable ABI. The normal way to do it is to expose function and types using the C abi, and import them in C as you would any other C library.  You should find this section relevant: <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/ffi.html#calling-rust-code-from-c\">https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/ffi.html#calling-rust-code-from-c</a></p>",
