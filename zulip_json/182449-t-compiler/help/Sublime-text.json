I usually using sublime-text as text editor with rust enhanced plugin. I haven't tried to enable it for the compiler as it uses the special <code>./x.py</code> build script and not cargo directly. Is there any tricks to make sublime-text work with the toolchain used by the compiler? In such a way that the build errors are reported directly in the code editor?</p>",
