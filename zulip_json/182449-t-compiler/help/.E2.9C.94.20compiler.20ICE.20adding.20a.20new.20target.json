I went through the rustc-dev-guide docs on adding a new target, and got an ICE during compilation.</p>\n<p>I opened an issue <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86829\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86829</a>, am I doing something obviously wrong, or is this a legitimate bug in rustc? I'll keep debugging if I'm doing something wrong.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance for any help</p>",
