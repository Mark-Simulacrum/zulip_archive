Currently I'm using a custom ad-hoc parser to parse really simple arguments, but that does not really scale to more complex attributes.<br>\nIs there some good existing approach to creating custom parsers for these TokenStreams?</p>\n<p>(I was hoping for something along the lines of the <code>parse</code> module provided by the <code>syn</code> crate, which however works on proc_macro TokenStreams)</p>",
