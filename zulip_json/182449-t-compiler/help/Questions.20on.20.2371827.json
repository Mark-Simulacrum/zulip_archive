I have a few questions to get it over the finish line, but the person who was originally helping me seems to be really busy.  I don't want to pester him, so someone suggested I reach out here on zulip.</p>\n<p>Specifically, answers to any of the following would be really helpful:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are there better ways to grow or shrink spans? I'm doing a lot of casting and arithmetic</li>\n<li>Given a span for a whole function definition, is there a standard way for shrinking it to just cover the method name / signature?</li>\n<li>Given a span, how can I look up the code snippet that that span covers?</li>\n<li>And, most importantly, given a type/expr, how can I get a human readable string for it, for error messages?</li>\n</ul>",
