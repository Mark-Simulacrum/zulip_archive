I'm trying to make it faster to re-build rustc after a <code>./x.py clean</code> (or <code>git clean -xfd</code> etc.). rustc guide shows a way to use system LLVM which I haven't tried it yet, but I'm wondering why we need to build LLVM from source if standard LLVM dists work. I think rustc guide doesn't say. Can I always use LLVM 7 to bootstrap rustc, or are there any features that won't work or tests that fail if I do that?</p>\n<p>(Sorry if this is not the right place for this question! Let me know if that's the case and I'll ask elsewhere)</p>",
