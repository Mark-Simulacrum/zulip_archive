But since I had to work with environmental variables I am not sure if it now works in general, especially since the fix checks for the \"CI\" variable.<br>\nShould I just create my PR (since it is just a minor testcase fix, nothing huge) and wait for feedback, or is there a way, that a mentor or higher skilled person would take a first \"look\" and maybe give me some tips, before I create the PR?</p>",
