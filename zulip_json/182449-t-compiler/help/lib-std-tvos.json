I was suggested to ask here from #t-libs/lib-std-on-tvos, as I can currently get libstd to somewhat compile after modifying libc/std sources, but for some reason the resulting library file is invalid, as it contains aarch64 code, but xcode complains it's a macos library file. Anyone an idea where is defined what libc is linked to? I suspect it might link to macos' libc.</p>",
