During the course of the work, I keep bumping into situations where I need to make some a minor change, like adding a derive somewhere. Then, as refactoring goes on, I no longer need the change. </p>\n<p>I feel like I'm in a bit of an odd position, because on the one hand the changes aren't strictly speaking related to the PR at this point, and on the other hand they're simple improvements. I don't know if I should split them into their own commit, or do a seperate miscellaneous PR that touches many different parts of the compiler, or actually go for putting each change into its own PR, even though each one would be like one to three lines, or what. Does anyone have advice on what I should do?</p>",
