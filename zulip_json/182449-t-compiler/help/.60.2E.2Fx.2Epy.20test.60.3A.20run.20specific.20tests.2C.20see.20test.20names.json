None of the following work:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>./x.py test library/core/result.rs</code> - path to file</li>\n<li><code>./x.py test library/core -- result</code> - trying to pass a module path to cargo test? idk</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2) How can I see the test names of tests as they run? All I see is green dots and it's not obvious which option makes the output more verbose (<code>--verbose</code>, oddly enough, does not help)</p>",
