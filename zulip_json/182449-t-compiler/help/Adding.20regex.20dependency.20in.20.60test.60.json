I've however run into a issue I'd like some feedback on. I would like to add the <code>regex</code> crate to the <code>Cargo.toml</code> of <code>test</code>, however this is not possible since <code>regex</code> depends on <code>core</code> and <code>std</code>. Adding the following to the <code>Cargo.toml</code> (std is required to do anything with regex):</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>regex = { version = &quot;1&quot;, default-features = false, features = [&#39;std&#39;] }\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>results in the following error:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>    Checking regex-syntax v0.6.22\nerror[E0463]: can&#39;t find crate for `std`\n\nerror: aborting due to previous error\n\nFor more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0463`.\nerror: could not compile `regex-syntax`\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Other dependencies, like <code>cfg-if</code> and <code>getopts</code> resolve this with <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/getopts/blob/master/Cargo.toml#L25\">a <code>rustc-dep-of-std</code> feature</a>. However, the <code>regex</code> crate doesn't have this feature, and I'm also not quite sure how selecting this feature solves the underlying problem. So I end up with 2 questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Is there a way to use the <code>regex</code> crate in <code>test</code>? If so, does this require making a <code>rustc-dep-of-std</code> feature for <code>regex</code>?</li>\n<li>How does the feature actually solve the problem? Due to the use of the <code>rustc-std-workspace-std</code> package?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thanks in advance :)</p>",
