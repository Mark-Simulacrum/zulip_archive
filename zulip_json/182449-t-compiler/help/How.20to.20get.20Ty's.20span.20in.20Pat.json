The problem is that it seems like I can only get the span for the ident, which is not what I'm looking for. For more context, I'm trying to make a connection between a type used in code and its definition. For the definition, no problem, I can look into the <code>FnDecl</code> from the input types, however I still need to be able to get the span from the <code>Body</code> and it doesn't like I can get it.</p>\n<p>If anyone has an idea?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>",
