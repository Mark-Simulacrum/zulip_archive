When codegenning a vtable, we want to give it a reasonable source location for debugging, and have decided as a temporary measure to have it point to the location of the impl block for the type-trait pair. (This doesn't always work directly, for example <code>Box&lt;dyn A + B&gt;</code>, but it will do for now.)</p>\n<p>Where can we find the <code>Span</code> for the <code>impl</code> block? Is there a way of accessing it given both the concrete <code>Ty</code>pe and the trait <code>Ty</code>pe?</p>\n<p>Please let me know if I can clarify anything. Thanks!</p>",
