Under certain circumstances involving recursive trait obligations, rustc recognizes that it would give redundant warnings and instead narrows them down to one. That would be great, except it also prints <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/dbe459dedd33470f2cb28101157de316caaffa66/compiler/rustc_trait_selection/src/traits/error_reporting/suggestions.rs#L2206\">a message saying that it's omitted warnings about redundant obligations</a>. I think that information isn't helpful and should be removed, since knowing that rustc has declined to give a warning is basically never helpful for an end user. However, I wanted to ask if I'm missing something before submitting a PR to change it.</p>",

It might be worth showing some sort of warning that suggests the possible presence of an infinite loop for very large numbers of recursive obligations. On the other hand,  we don't mention the possibility of an infinite loop for most cases where the recursion limit is reached. Also, it seems like the other lines of the error message probably make the problem reasonably clear, though there maybe some room for improvement. I'm still inclined to remove the message. I don't really know if it's worth trying to handle the infinite loop case seperately or if there are any other situations that I'm not seeing.</p>",
