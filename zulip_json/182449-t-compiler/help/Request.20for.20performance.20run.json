PR <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/76244\">#76244</a> implemented this change.</p>\n<p>Generally, results were as expected: an instruction count decrease of about a percent. The instruction count for the unicode crates increased by about 3%, which @nnethercote speculated to be caused by a quirk of inlining or codegen. As the results were generally positive, and for chalk integration, this was also a step in the right direction, the PR was r+'d regardless.</p>\n<p>However, wall-time performance results show a much larger performance degradation: 25%, as mentioned by @Mark-Simulacrum.</p>\n<p>This PR, for now, reverts <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/76244\">#76244</a> and attempts to find out, which change caused the regression.</p>\n</blockquote>",
