Just one tip (I saw your question in the issue): use <code>./x.py build --stage 1 library/std</code> to build, then do <code>rustup toolchain link stage1 build/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/stage1</code>. After that keep rebuilding with the same command (no need for the <code>rustup</code> command again) and use the compiler you built with <code>rustc +stage1</code> or <code>cargo +stage1</code>.</p>",
