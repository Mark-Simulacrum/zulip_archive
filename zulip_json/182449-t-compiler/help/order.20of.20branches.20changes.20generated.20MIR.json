This also leads to different facts being generated for polonius and other weirdnesses. It doesn't seem to cause any issues but I'm confused as to why this would occur. I posted example MIR here: <a href=\"#narrow/stream/183875-wg-formal-methods/topic/Inconsistency.20in.20MIR.20for.20branches/near/214769775\">https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/183875-wg-formal-methods/topic/Inconsistency.20in.20MIR.20for.20branches/near/214769775</a></p>",
