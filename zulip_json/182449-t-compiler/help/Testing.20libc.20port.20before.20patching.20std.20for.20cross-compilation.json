Until now, I have completed porting libc (at least no more build errors originate from it). Now I am getting build errors for missing functions inside std, but I'd like to make sure libc is mostly correct before patching std itself. Is it somehow possible to test if libc is done correctly, even if it involves making a no-std target?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>",

I believe libc has a build script checking against the header files, but I don't know how to do this and if you need to change it to make it work for serenityos.</p>",
