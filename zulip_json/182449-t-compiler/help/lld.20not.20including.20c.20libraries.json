For example, I have a crate depending on <a href=\"https://github.com/Andlon/mkl-sys\">https://github.com/Andlon/mkl-sys</a> , which breaks when using <code>-C link-arg=-fuse-ld=lld</code>. I have made a PR which disables <code>--as-needed</code> when using lld here <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/88814\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/88814</a>, but this approach is suboptimal since it includes unneeded libraries, as seen in the PR description. Any ideas?</p>",
