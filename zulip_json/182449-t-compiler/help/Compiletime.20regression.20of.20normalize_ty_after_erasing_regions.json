The same query caused a <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/67982\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/67982\">huge regression</a> when the <code>IntoFuture</code> lowering was implemented. In both cases the query is still evaluated the same number of times, it just seems to take significantly more time to run.</p>\n<p>Does anyone have an idea about what could cause this or how to investigate this? I'm not very familiar with how that query works.</p>",
