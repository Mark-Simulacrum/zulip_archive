I am building a codegen that heavily takes things from rustc_codegen_llvm, it uses some of its types, but it especially uses its LLVM FFI and rustc_llvm wrappers. But... this causes a bit of an issue, im not sure how to get this to build, if i try to build it, i get linker errors for the llvm stuff. Which i guess makes sense because im not building rustc itself, but then how do i get around this? I think id have to clone rustc_llvm or somehow tell rustc to rebuild rustc_llvm every time. Any ideas?</p>",

Now i just need to find libnvvm and then i might be able to finally write a Cuda kernel in rust <span aria-label=\"eyes\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f440\" role=\"img\" title=\"eyes\">:eyes:</span></p>",
