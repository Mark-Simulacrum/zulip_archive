        "content": "<p>I've spent a couple of evenings with Rust trying to get it to produce binaries for this unsupported platform. I chose these versions because LLVM 7.1.0 is the last one with official PPC Darwin support. When building with <code>x.py --target=powerpc-apple-darwin.json</code> I'm getting this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>LLVM ERROR: symbol &#39;_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_&#39; can not be undefined in a subtraction expression\nerror: could not compile `std`.\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Here is my current target specification JSON, based mostly on creative cut'n'paste from the i686 Darwin and ppc Linux target specs. <a href=\"/user_uploads/4715/QEj21OfMs8ESmUpBkg7rGME_/powerpc-apple-darwin.json\">powerpc-apple-darwin.json</a></p>\n<p>When running build with <code>-vv</code> I get the exact command that's failing but am having a slightly hard time figuring out what is amiss. I know next to nothing about Rust compiler internals but the concept of GOT is somewhat familiar to me. I'm guessing this is happening because something in there would like to refer to a symbol via the GOT, but the GOT base address is not specified at all and thus this fails. I did manually specify PIC relocation model in the target JSON hoping this would trigger something in there to emit the <code>_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_</code> symbol but still get the same result.</p>\n<p>FWIW, with C the LLVM/CLang combo produces object files which can be copied over to the PPC Mac, linked there and successfully executed.</p>\n<p>If you can point me in some direction, that'd be highly appreciated.</p>",
