These two new types contain a vector/slice of <code>FieldDef</code>s, like a normal struct definition. The problem is that <code>rustc_typeck</code> converts a type from HIR to TyS with <code>ast_ty_to_ty_inner</code>, so I need to implement a conversion for the two new variants. My idea was to adapt the conversion of a struct definition, but there's not an explicit conversion or I didn't look hard enough. Maybe I'm misinterpreting what <code>ast_ty_to_ty_inner</code> does?</p>\n<p>I'm leaving my PR draft here in case you need to look at the code.<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/84571\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/84571</a></p>",
