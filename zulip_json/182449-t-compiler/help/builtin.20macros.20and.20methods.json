But how does that actually work? where are builtin macros defined? how does builtin stuff work, aka how does rustc insert the definitions into the final binary? and how are builtin proc macros defined? Thank you <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>\n<p>Edit: if there are any resources on this then i would appreciate them, i read the rustc dev guide a while ago, if there is a section i have either missed it or it was recently added.</p>",
