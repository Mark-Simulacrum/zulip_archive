One of the ways it could be handled is that the macro could be altered to branch on literals, but I still have to choose between using <code>write_str</code> or <code>write</code>, which are not viable if I need to service both <code>fmt::Write</code> and <code>io::Write</code>, right? <del>It seems like if I call <code>write_fmt</code>, I would just get the same overhead I currently do (though I should test that more thoroughly).</del> Answer: yes.</p>\n<p>So either io::Write needs to somehow grow <code>write_str</code> or fmt::Write needs to grow <code>write</code> to take the \"obvious\" solution of \"just special case literals\" or I need to be able to detect what traits are applicable and in scope (lol glwt) but that seems to be invalid due to macro hygiene?</p>",
