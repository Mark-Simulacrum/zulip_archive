Trying to build an application followed by obfuscation with my own <a href=\"http://obfuscator.so\">obfuscator.so</a>, can anyone advise how to build using cargo and pass my <a href=\"http://obfuscator.so\">obfuscator.so</a> via opt?</p>\n<p>understand that I probably could use cargo rustc -- --emit=llvm-ir then follow up with opt etc then finally with clang, however, my application have quite a number of crate dependencies hence it is easier to build via cargo. Appreciate if anyone could advise. TIA</p>",
