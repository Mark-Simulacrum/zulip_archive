I was looking at implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86759\">#86759</a>, and I had a few questions about your comment there.</p>\n<p>1) What is it about this particular example that would make the message from E0312 helpful and the one from E0621 unhelpful? I'm guessing that it's not <em>always</em> the case that E0621 isn't helpful, but I don't know.</p>\n<p>2) More specifically, I noticed that this produced an even less helpful error before your PR <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/85240\">#85240</a>. Would adding an else to the if statement you inserted in that PR be a good way to produce a more helpful diagnostic for this case?</p>",
