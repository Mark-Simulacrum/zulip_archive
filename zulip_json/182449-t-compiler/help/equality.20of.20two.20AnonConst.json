So I went ahead and decided to try to implement proposal 2 from the linked comment.<br>\nI am aware that anything in this direction would first have to go through some kind of RFC, but my main goal is to understand a bit of the rustc internals :)</p>\n<p>So currently I'm stuck at figuring out how to decide if two  <code>AnonConst</code> A and B are \"equal\".<br>\nFor simplicity sake I would define equal as follows (which I would say is the most minimal proposal possible):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The AST of A equals the AST of B</li>\n<li>The substitutions for A are the same as for B</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I already implemented checking if the substitutions are the same, but am struggling with getting the AST of A, given the corresponding <code>DefId</code>.</p>\n<p>If someone has another idea how to define \"equal\" for A and B I would appreciate some feedback :)</p>\n<p>Have a nice day,<br>\nSimon</p>",
