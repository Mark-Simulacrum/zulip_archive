Basically the problem is I'm unable to make shared libraries of my Rust crates if I use function from core or std and I think the problem is because core and std are not built with PIC relocation model. I'd like to try building rustc with std and core built with PIC for wasm32. Can anyone help me on this? I'm not sure what to update in config.toml.</p>",

IIRC there has been some work to make it easier.</p>",
