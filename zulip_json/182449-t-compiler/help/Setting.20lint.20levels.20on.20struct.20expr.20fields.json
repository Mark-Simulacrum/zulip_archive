I've tracked down the issue to a combination of the fact that struct expr attributes aren't stored in the lint level map, and the <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/95e0a2c50d063bd7eb79aa55d16cd5fee715c280/src/librustc_typeck/check/expr.rs#L1215\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/95e0a2c50d063bd7eb79aa55d16cd5fee715c280/src/librustc_typeck/check/expr.rs#L1215\">stability of a struct field attribute is checked by looking at the HIR ID of the whole expression</a>, not the field.</p>\n<p>It's easy enough to fix the lint level map issue. I added a <code>visit_field</code> method to <code>intravisit::Visitor</code> and then used that in the <code>lint_levels</code> query. However, changing the stability check is harder: I run into a <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/95e0a2c50d063bd7eb79aa55d16cd5fee715c280/src/librustc/ty/context.rs#L2586\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/95e0a2c50d063bd7eb79aa55d16cd5fee715c280/src/librustc/ty/context.rs#L2586\"><code>bug!()</code></a> because the HIR ID of the field has no parent.</p>\n<p>I'm wondering what to do next. I could try to give the field a parent in the HIR map, but this is a significant change because it would involve adding a new HIR node. Is there a better solution?</p>",
