For library crates this is currently working well, as I have the compiler produce a staticlib which I then link with the OS when that builds. However, this approach doesn't currently work with binary crates, as they seem to be self contained and so produce many link errors when compiling. Would it be possible for me to have binary crates produce a staticlib, with some defined entry point that would eventually call the main method, or is there some other approach that might work for this? I'd prefer not to have to build the OS within Rust, which I believe is what Hermit does.</p>",
