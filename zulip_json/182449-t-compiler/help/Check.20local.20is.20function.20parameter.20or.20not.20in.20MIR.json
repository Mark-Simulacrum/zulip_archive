A wrong suggestion is here and we know local in MIR. I want to check if this local is belong to a function parameter and if that that function is in impl of a trait, then disable the suggestion because changing signature of impl trait is meaningless (if I succeed I will try to find that trait and move suggestion there instead of disabling it completely) how I can do that?</p>",
