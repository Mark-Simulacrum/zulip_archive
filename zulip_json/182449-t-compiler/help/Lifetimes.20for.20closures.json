That should get you to the correct crate, which is half the battle.</li>\n<li>Follow the trail of breadcrumbs upward. Who calls that function that produces the diagnostic? Under what conditions? Which function produces the data that is used to decide whether or not the diagnostic should be produced?</li>\n<li>Recompile rustc with additional debug/logging and run it with <code>RUSTC_LOG</code> on the minimal example to help you better figure out what data is influencing the compiler's decisions: <a href=\"https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/tracing.html\">https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/tracing.html</a></li>\n</ol>",
