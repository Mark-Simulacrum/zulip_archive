Of course, since the compiler runs on older processors for which this might not be the case, it might not be possible to actually ship a compiler binary built this way.</p>",

This title indicates that they are someone who contributes regularly.</p>\n<p>It is hard to define the precise conditions when such a promotion is appropriate. Being promoted to contributor is not just a function of checking various boxes. But the general sense is that someone is ready when they have demonstrated three things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Staying power\" -- the person should be contributing on a regular basis in some way. This might for example mean that they have completed a few projects.</li>\n<li>\"Independence and familiarity\" -- they should be acting somewhat independently when taking on tasks, at least within the scope of the working group. They should plausibly be able to mentor others on simple PRs.</li>\n<li>\"Cordiality\" -- contributors will be members of the organization and are held to a higher standard with respect to the Code of Conduct. They should not only obey the letter of the CoC but also its spirit.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",
