I created 2 functions for rust that i thought were necessary, and i tried to submit them, but the \"pr checks\" doesn't  seem to accept the code, i tested the code on my computer and it works fine, it's only two functions nothing crazy (it should run). I've been racking my brain about why it's not building, it keeps saying \"error: function is never used\", that being the only 2 errors, (one for each function). I have no idea if i'm being dumb, but i may need some guidance on how to contribute code.
