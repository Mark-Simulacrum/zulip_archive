I've found where the derive is implemented: <code>compiler/rustc_builtin_macros/src/deriving/default.rs</code>, and see that it's currently (and correctly) forbidden on enums. Rust-analyzer tells me the two fields of the <code>StaticEnum</code> variant are <code>EnumDef</code> and <code>Vec&lt;(Ident, Span, StaticFields)&gt;</code>. Where do I start from there?</p>\n<p>Assume I know little about how the compiler works, to be honest. The extent of knowledge I have with compilers and ASTs is a single college course where we implemented Scheme and playing around a little bit with Babel. Certainly nothing as complex as Rust's AST and the quite dense code that is this derive macro.</p>",
