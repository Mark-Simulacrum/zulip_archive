I can search for the template string just fine, but I can't figure out how to translate that to a span inside the source representation.<br>\nFor example if it's a raw string, or the string has escape characters, the offsets are wrong.  Using the source string is hard because I still would need to parse escape characters, and also deal with the double quotes or other source characters that I need to interpret as the actual produced string.<br>\nWhat would be the best way to find the right span in the source from positions in the parsed string?</p>",
