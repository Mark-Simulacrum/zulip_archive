That handles all the normalization that compiletest performs.  There's also some interaction with rustc which normalizes some output via the <code>-Zui-testing</code> flag, but compiletest adds some additional translations.  You could, in theory, write it manually, but is there some reason you can't use <code>--bless</code>?</p>",
