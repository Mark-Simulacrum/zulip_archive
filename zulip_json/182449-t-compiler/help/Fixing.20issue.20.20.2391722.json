Exciting times! </p>\n<p>The error is caused by calling read_from_end() from stdin on Windows with a buffer with less than 4 bytes. I have a bugfix but have a couple questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Adding the bug to a test case doesn't seem possible, since there must be interaction with the console. Is there a test suite that would allow that kind of interaction.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The bugfix is slightly inefficient for small amounts of bytes being read. I fear that this might affect benchmarks in a noticeable way, and was wondering if this should be compiled only for Windows. </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Should I start by doing a pull request with the fix, or should I find a way to make a test fail with the old toolchain before I do that?</p>",
