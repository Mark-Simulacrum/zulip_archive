I jumped on <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/73931\">this issue</a> but I've been fairly stuck. From the suggestion, it seemed like there would be a reasonable way of reusing <code>add_missing_lifetime_specifiers_label</code> in <code>different_lifetimes.rs</code> where the trait error is reported, but I have been having a tough time understanding how everything fits together (esp. <code>LifetimeContext</code> etc.). If anyone has any recommendations for resources I can read to get up to speed on this area of the compiler or if anyone can nudge me in the right direction that would be awesome! Thanks in advance :)</p>",
