I have tried <code>TyCtxt::crates()</code> and <code>TyCtxt::dependency_formats()</code>, but the former sometimes reports both <code>panic_unwind</code> and <code>panic_abort</code> (which are not compatible), and the later causes \"crate ... required to be available in rlib format, but was not found in this form\" errors (because only <code>rmeta</code> files are available).</p>",
