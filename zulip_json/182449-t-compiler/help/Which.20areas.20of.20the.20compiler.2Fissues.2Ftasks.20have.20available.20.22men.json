For that I'm curious which areas of the compiler, or issues, or tasks (maybe refactoring or something like that), have people available for questions. So far I fixed a few simple issues, but when I tried to fix more involved issues (<a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80258\">#80258</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79590\">#79590</a>) getting answers for my questions turned out to be a challenge. So instead I'm thinking of working on a part of the compiler that has someone willing to answer questions.</p>\n<p>Any ideas on what those areas or issues might be? Thanks.</p>",
