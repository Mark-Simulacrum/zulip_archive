For example:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>let x = Vec::new();\n... // bunch of other stuff\nuse(x)\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>If I'm looking at the MIR statement for <code>use(x)</code>, I want to find where <code>x</code> was originally initialized (i.e. line 1). In MIR, a bunch of intermediate <code>dest = move src;</code> statements can get created and it's kinda difficult to chase them backward to the original use. I'm guessing this is what the liveness stuff does, but I have no idea where to start with it. Is what I'm trying to do possible in MIR?</p>\n<p>I'm new to this part of the compiler, so sorry if terminology is wrong / badly explained.</p>",
