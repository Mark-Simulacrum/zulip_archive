I'm pretty sure the main fix would need to go in <code>compiler/rustc_resolve/src/late.rs</code>, with some stuff going in <code>compiler/rustc_resolve/src/diagnostics.rs</code>. However, <code>late.rs</code> is a bit of a maze. I think whatever fix I write should probably be in <code>resolve_qpath</code>, but I can't even figure out which method I need to call to check if there's a similarly named associated type.</p>\n<p>I think I have two questions. 1) Is this something I should leave for someone more expirienced? I only have a few PRs under my belt. 2) If it is something it makes sense for me to work on, do people have any advice?</p>",
