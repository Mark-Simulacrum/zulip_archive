I am on <code>x86_64-apple-darwin</code>, which I imagine is not tested as often as e.g. Linux in CI, so would that be the reason I don't see the same failures on CI when submitting PRs? The failures appear to system linker errors. Perhaps the tests should be ignored on macOS / Apple platforms?</p>",
