I can't send it over - this <code>rustc</code> modification for a new codegen feature. Now if I take the dumped this LLVM IR from rustc and pass it directly to <code>llc</code>, it compiles successfully. I expected that with the dumped IR I would get the same infinite loop as I got when rustc tries to compile this crate. Is it possible that I need to pass special args to <code>llc</code> to mimick the same way the backend is invoked by rustc?</p>",
