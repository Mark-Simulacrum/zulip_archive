My approach right now is to compare outer ExpnId's of the expr and its parent. If they match, then the expansion is bigger than my expr. The problem is that a built-in macro (namely format_args) expansion has exprs whose outer expansion is not format_args (its the calling macro instead). Their parent node's outer expansion, on the other hand, is format_args, I compare them and get a false positive. Is there an easier way to achieve my goal that I am not aware of? If not, can you think of the way to fix my approach?</p>",
