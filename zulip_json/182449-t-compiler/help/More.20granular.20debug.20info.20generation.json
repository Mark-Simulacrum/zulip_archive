I would attach a debugger and inspect the variables to give me a feel of what kind of data is being handled by the function. However, setting <code>debuginfo-level=2</code>in config.toml results in a very slow build. Is there a way to limit the full info to just the rustc_mir crate for example? If this is not an option, what else could I do to inspect the variables other than print debugging?</p>",
