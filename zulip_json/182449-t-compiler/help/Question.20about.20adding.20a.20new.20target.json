I have read through the <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/target-tier-policy.html\">https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/target-tier-policy.html</a> page and it seems to not specify if a Tier 3 target needs to have any popularity requirement. Am I understanding it correctly?</p>\n<p>By the way, the target I want to add is <code>riscv64gc-linux-android</code>, and <code>riscv64gc-unknown-linux-gnu</code> is currently a Rust Tier 2 w/ Host target.</p>",
