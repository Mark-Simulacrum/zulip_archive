So far I kinda see that the <code>.rustc</code> section encoded a <code>String</code> of this info at offset 12(metadata header is 8 bytes, and crate root position info is 4 bytes) then I don't know excat how many bytes to look at from here, and decode those bytes in what encoding scheme? Anyone know how this works?</p>\n<p>I also navigated through the <code>rustc_serialize</code> crate to make some sense of this process, and I don't really get what <code>Lazy&lt;T&gt;</code> is? It says it remembers previous node, and nodes are in postfix tree, and the tree is metadata as a whole, but it seems kinda too abstract to me. Would someone explain those with, you know, potentially some example? <span aria-label=\"sweat smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f605\" role=\"img\" title=\"sweat smile\">:sweat_smile:</span></p>",
