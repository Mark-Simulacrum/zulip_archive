The Zig project uses it to consolidate all of the <code>glibc</code> symbols across many <code>glibc</code> releases into a single index file, which in turn is <a href=\"https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/1e481dfef5a2241bfc5460214dbd0daffe5063bc/src/glibc.zig\">used by the Zig compiler</a> to query individually versioned <code>glibc</code> symbols associated with a given <code>glibc</code> library version. This is handy for use cases like cross-compilation.
