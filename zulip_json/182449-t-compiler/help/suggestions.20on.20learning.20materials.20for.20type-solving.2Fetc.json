I feel in small chunks I can grasp some basic concepts, but as a whole, the terms and structure of the code have me quite lost, and they seem very abstracted from how the type system works in my head when I'm programming in rust</p>\n<p>Are there any good resources (including textbooks) to get at least some familiarity with how real type solvers work? I never took a typing class in college, I have Types and Programming Languages, but im wondering if that is too theoretical</p>",
