I'm able to reproduce with the repository using the commit that was reported but I've been unable to produce a smaller reproduction based on what I'm observing the code do (I've looked at what the macro expands to, and can see the code that the lint would trigger for, but any macros that I write aren't doing it). I'm now trying to use a local build of the compiler so I can debug what's triggering it and work back from that to make a test case. However, if I use <code>rustup toolchain link rust1-stage1 /path/to/stage1/folder</code> and then change the <code>rust-toolchain</code> file,  eventually I get an error like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>error: librustc_plugin-4f4ec7f541bc84cb.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n  --&gt; components/script/lib.rs:15:11\n   |\n15 | #![plugin(script_plugins)]\n   |           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>I can work around it by adding <code>/path/to/stage1/lib/rustlib/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib</code> (where this file lives) to <code>LD_PRELOAD_PATH</code>, but then I immediately hit <code>cannot access a scoped thread local variable without calling `set` first</code>. Anyone got any ideas on what to try?</p>",
