        "content": "<p>Hi, I am working on a compiler plugin and need to find the trait <em>declarations</em> for all traits implemented on a type that are in scope. More specifically, for some method declaration taking a parameter of type <code>Type</code> that implements <code>Trait1</code> and <code>Trait2</code>, I would like to get a reference (<code>DefId</code>) to the <em>declaration</em> of <code>Trait1</code> considering it is the only one of the two in scope (at the definition point of the method).</p>\n<p>I looked through <code>TyCtxt</code> and found ways to get traits in scope, trait declarations from some implementation, but no way to get implementations/declarations for some type. The only reliable way I stumbled upon is via defined methods on the type using <code>impl_of_method</code>. The issue is that I need to work mostly with marker traits which don't declare any methods.</p>\n<p>Does anyone here know what methods/documentation I should look at to achieve this? Cheers!</p>",
