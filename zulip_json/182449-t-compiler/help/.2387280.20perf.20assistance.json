        "content": "<p><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/87280\">#87280</a> causes a &gt;15% perf regression in some stress tests and a ~3-4% regression for pretty much everything else.</p>\n<p>I tried a bunch of things to reduce the perf cost of this but none of them actually mattered.</p>\n<p>I don't have a good idea what might be the main culprit of this regression and would want to avoid having to binary search my commit history to figure out what's actually so costly here. Does one of you have an idea what causes this regression or at least how to better interpret the perf results (over on a different pr so that I don't drown any reviews: <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/87407\">#87407</a>)</p>",
