Due to bootstrapping,\n# building without optimizations takes much longer than optimizing. Further, some platforms\n# fail to build without this optimization (c.f. #65352).\n#optimize = true\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/65352\">cited issue</a> is a windows bug closed last year, so this comment may be stale.</p>\n<p>FWIW, if you turn optimisation off today, then many tests fail with weird linkage errors etc. Here's <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/vext01/720205a993043b1824dbae19799c082a\">the full output of a test run without optimisation</a>.</p>\n<p>So I'm wondering: should debug builds work? And is there any interest in having them work?</p>\n<p>Many Thanks!</p>",
