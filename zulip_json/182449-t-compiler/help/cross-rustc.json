I'm trying to build rust to work in our build system.<br>\nThe goal is to build a rustc which has build=x86 host=x86 and target=armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf<br>\nIe the <em>default</em> from a --print target-spec-json would say armv7*</p>\n<p>This matters because solutions like wrapping rustc and specifying --target isn't quite the same wrt target dirs and other stuff<br>\nThe reason I need this is to do with how we optimise the cross-build process for the distro (ie rather than qemu an arm rustc we intercept the call to rustc and directly run an x86 cross-rustc... someone would have asked \"why?\" :D )</p>\n<p>As it stands I can build our arm crates in x86 land using ./configure --build=i686-unknown-linux-gnu --host=i686-unknown-linux-gnu --target=armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf<br>\nBut the rustc doesn't produce armv7 code by default</p>\n<p>OK - hope that's enough of a conversation starter</p>",
