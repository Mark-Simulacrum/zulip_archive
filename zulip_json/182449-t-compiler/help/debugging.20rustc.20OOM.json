I'm trying to debug an issue that causes exponential growth in rustc's memory usage for seemingly trivial code. I've used <code>-Zself-profile</code> etc to disambiguate the issue down to evaluate_obligation/codegen_fulfill_obligation but I'm not sure how to gather more information to determine exactly what bit of code is adversarial and exercising the issue etc. The <code>RUST_LOG</code> output for those queries comes in the form of UUIDs that I'm unfamiliar with and don't know how to convert to a human-readable form, and even so there's no timing or memory info in RUST_LOG so I don't know which evaluations are causing the problem. Could someone point me to the usual methodology for investigating things like this? I'm blocked on this issue across essentially all of my active research as it occurs in essentially any source that uses any but the most trivial generated code from my <code>protocol</code> crate (<a href=\"https://github.com/noocene/protocol\">https://github.com/noocene/protocol</a>) and I'd really appreciate some guidance so I can contribute a fix or at least better understand the problem. My familiarity with the trait solver doesn't go much beyond the cursory description in the compiler internals book.</p>",

This makes sense (given the amount of memory that's being used to store that huge <code>obligations</code> Vec) I would presume the Hash implementation isn't all that slow, it's just a ridiculously hot path here because that structure is so large.</p>\n<p>This really just confirms prior concerns though. The question isn't whether that obligation list is big, it's <strong>why</strong> it's so big. I don't know whether it's a deduplication failure or a huge growth before deduplication ever happens because the <code>perf</code> output just uses sampling so I have no idea how many times a given function was called or how long it took on a given call etc.</p>",

I'd like to make some progress on this issue before I start uni in a month or so, at that point I'll be more focused on my research and I'd prefer not to be blocked on a compiler bug.
