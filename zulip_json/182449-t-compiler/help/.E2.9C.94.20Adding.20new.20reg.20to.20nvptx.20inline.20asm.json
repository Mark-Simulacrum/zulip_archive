Currently we have <code>reg32</code> and <code>reg64</code> which are <code>.b32</code> and <code>.b64</code> regs, however, OptiX complains if you do not use float regs for certain things (i managed to work around it with a hack but its that, a hack). So i would like to add <code>freg32</code> and <code>freg64</code>. LLVM supports it just fine AFAIK.</p>",
