(I'm working on yet another verifier for rust as part of a research project) I have a question: if I have a <code>rustc_middle::ty::FieldDef</code>, can I somehow easily get the corresponding <code>rustc_hir::FieldDef</code>? Through TyCtxt or TypeckResults maybe? I'm currently using <code>TyCtxt::hir().get_if_local(field_def.did)</code> but it feels like there may be a more straightforward approach. Thanks!</p>",
