Could it be that the top (<code>coercions-debug</code> to <code>deep-vector-debug</code>) is the runtime performance and the part below beginning with <code>bootstrap timings; variance is 1-3% on smaller benchmarks! Values in seconds.</code> is the compile-time performance? Is that correct?<br>\nIf that's correct, is it right to say that compile time performance improved here but runtime performance worsened?</p>",
