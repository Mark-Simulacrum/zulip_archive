I looked at the code pointers given, but they live in entirely different modules, and don't seem to share many compatible types. It's not super clear to me how the two functions (LifetimeContext::resolve_elided_lifetimes, NiceRegionError::try_report_anon_anon_conflict) relate to each other. Where do I even start with this?</p>\n<p>If the answer is \"dig into the code more\", I will also do that :). Any help would be appreciated!</p>",
