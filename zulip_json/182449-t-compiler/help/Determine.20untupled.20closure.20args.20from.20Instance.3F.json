We previously were doing the check at call-site by whether the function's type kind was a <code>Closure</code>, but this fails in cases where the call is through a vtable, such as this one:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"kd\">let</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">p</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>: <span class=\"kp\">&amp;</span><span class=\"nc\">dyn</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nb\">Fn</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kt\">i32</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">&amp;|</span><span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"o\">|</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"fm\">assert!</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">==</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">);</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">p</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">);</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Instead, we are moving to match the LLVM backend (and Cranelift's) decision logic for the call site, which involves checking whether the call's ABI is <code>Abi::RustCall</code>. However, I'm now running into issues where our functions fail to type check because we are again relying on whether the function is a <code>Closure</code> in generating the function signature itself (code is <a href=\"https://github.com/model-checking/rmc/blob/22d72ef243a695cf3d48f517f61ab0a8a9142dc0/compiler/rustc_codegen_llvm/src/gotoc/metadata.rs#L305\">here</a>). If I try to check the ABI against  <code>Abi::RustCall</code> there as well, we run into type issues in how the untupled arguments are used within the function.</p>\n<p>Is the correct fix to check the call ABI against <code>Abi::RustCall</code>when generating the function itself (and it's type signature), and then insert logic like <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/a55748ffe94e71f841c7b1d752779b0db138b342/compiler/rustc_codegen_ssa/src/mir/mod.rs#L280\">this</a> from the LLVM backend to re-tuple the args? Or is there another way to determine the correct, untupled function signature from an <code>Instance</code>?</p>\n<p>Thanks so much!</p>",

        "content": "<p>If the abi is \"rust-call\", you must take all arguments except for the last one verbatim and untuple the last one. When codegening the actual body, you must check if <code>mir.spread_arg == Some(param)</code> where <code>param</code> is the MIR level parameter you are currently codegening and in that case take all the remaining parameters and put it in the <code>param</code> tuple. If <code>mir.spread_arg</code> is <code>None</code>, that means you are a closure and the parameters are already untupled.</p>",

I noticed there's already a <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/fed59d669c5ca3c0e9c39dcb1f6510b5876ede64/compiler/rustc_codegen_cranelift/src/abi/mod.rs#L186\">comment in the Cranelift backend</a> saying the logic is adapted from elsewhere, and it's looking like RMC will have a very similar comment. Is it an intentional design choice to leave the decision to do the transformation on each backend, or is this something that might be moved to MIR in the future?</p>",
