I don't know if you are still working on this, but looking at the issue, you should check if it is using <code>Default::default</code> or <code>SomeType::default</code>. If the latter is used, then you suggest <code>let a: SomeType = opt_expr.unwrap_or_default()</code>, if the former is used, then you can suggest <code>let a = opt_expr.unwrap_or_default()</code>.</p>",

I'm not sure if it's sufficient, because there are cases where <code>SomeType::default</code> is used but the type annotation isn't necessary, and ideally we wouldn't suggestion <code>let a: SomeType</code> there, but I'll keep it in mind</p>",
