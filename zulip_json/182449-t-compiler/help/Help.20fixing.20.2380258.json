I have some free time this week and the next and I'd like to fix <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80258\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80258</a> which has been bothering me for a while. Could anyone give me some pointers on where to start? I read <a href=\"http://wfcheck.rs\">wfcheck.rs</a> and probing stuff, but I'm lost. The code is quite complicated. If someone could give me some pointers (or a relevant read list) that'd be very helpful. Thanks!</p>",

        "content": "<p>I recommend looking at the debug log output of the code you're trying to fix. It can be very useful to help visualize what different functions are doing. Make sure that you have <code>debug = true</code> in your <code>config.toml</code>, otherwise there won't be any log output. I recommend running a command like:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Bash Session\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gp\">$</span> <span class=\"nv\">RUSTC_LOG</span><span class=\"o\">=</span>path::to::module_youre_interested_in<span class=\"o\">=</span>debug <span class=\"nv\">RUSTC_LOG_COLOR</span><span class=\"o\">=</span>always rustc +stage1 path/to/code-youre-trying-to-fix.rs <span class=\"p\">&amp;|</span> less -R\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>It will show the log output in a pager, with colors.</p>\n<p>If you're not sure what <code>+stage1</code> means, take a look at <a href=\"https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/building/how-to-build-and-run.html#creating-a-rustup-toolchain\">https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/building/how-to-build-and-run.html#creating-a-rustup-toolchain</a></p>",
