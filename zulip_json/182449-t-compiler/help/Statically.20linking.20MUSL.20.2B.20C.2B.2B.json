Most of that PR made it in later, but the <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/6d9154a830dd9773fe8a4e34e1fc3dfb1ca6f935\">commit that fixes the issue</a> and caused the regression didn't. My understanding is that it adds a new dependency on libgcc, or some other implementation of the Itanium C++ ABI, and those might not always be present (they will be if C++ code is involved, but the attempted fix depends on them in any case).</p>\n<p>Not sure who knows best what a proper fix here would look like, maybe <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"123856\">@Vadim Petrochenkov</span>, since you recently did some work on musl linkage IIRC?</p>",
