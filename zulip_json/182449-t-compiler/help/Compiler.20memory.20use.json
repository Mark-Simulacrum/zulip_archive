However, in 1.47.0 the build will get reaped by the OOM killer with -j4 and even with -j2. I haven't managed to complete a -j1 build yet because it takes a long time... Is there a known issue with 2x+ increased memory usage in 1.47? There was a configuration change that set codegen-units-std = 1, could that cause this kind of change?</p>",
