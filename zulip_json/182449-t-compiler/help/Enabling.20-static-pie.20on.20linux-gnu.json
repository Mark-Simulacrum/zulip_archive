I raised <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/86374\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/86374</a> a few weeks ago which (optimistically) enables <code>-static-pie</code> support for the <code>x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu</code> target (similar to the <code>-musl</code> target).  This MR has languished a bit, in part because the change fails CI, but (as I commented in the MR discussion) it's possible that the better fix to the failing CI job is to upgrade the CI environment.  What can/should I do to help unblock this MR?</p>",
