The only thing I could find is <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70345\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70345</a>.</p>\n<p>However, I need this option to switch to GNU <code>as</code> on some <code>mipsel</code> devices that have issues with<code>ll/sc</code> which LLVM <code>as</code> does not currently provide a fix.</p>\n<p>Is there any way to use it on a stable channel Rust compiler? If not, is there any suggestion on how to restore this functionality?</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>",
