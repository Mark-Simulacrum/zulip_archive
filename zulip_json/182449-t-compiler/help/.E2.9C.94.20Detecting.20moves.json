However, according to the blog, it seems like Polonius only supports analyzing borrows but doesn't support moves and initialization. I'm just curious about why moves are not currently supported. Is there a possible way to detect a move operation that we can make use of? Please let me know if you have any ideas or suggestions! Thank you ;)</p>",
