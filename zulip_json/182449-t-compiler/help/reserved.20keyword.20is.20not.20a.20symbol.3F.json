I removed <code>meta</code> from the <code>Symbols {}</code> identifiers and added it as a keyword:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>        // Edition-specific keywords that are used in stable Rust.\n        Async:              &quot;async&quot;, // &gt;= 2018 Edition only\n        Await:              &quot;await&quot;, // &gt;= 2018 Edition only\n        Dyn:                &quot;dyn&quot;, // &gt;= 2018 Edition only\n\n        // Edition-specific keywords that are used in unstable Rust or reserved for future use.\n        Try:                &quot;try&quot;, // &gt;= 2018 Edition only\n        Meta:               &quot;meta&quot;, // &gt;= 2018 Edition only\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>However, this then generates errors in <code>src/librustc_expand/mbe/macro_parser.rs</code> because the meta symbol can no longer be found in rustc_span::sym::*, as explained by the comment. However I am now confused as this \"meta\" seems to be referring to meta items for Attributes (<a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/attributes.html\">https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/attributes.html</a>), which is not the \"meta\" I wanted to change the behaviour of. Does anyone know where I'm going wrong or maybe some pointers as to what fixing this issue would involve?</p>",
