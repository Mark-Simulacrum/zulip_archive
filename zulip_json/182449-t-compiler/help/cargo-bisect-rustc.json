This narrowed it down to 2018-08-21(I think?) It was between commits 20dc0c5c7 and 3bc2ca7e4. I'm trying to bisect to the exact commit manually (since the builds aren't available anymore, I'm trying to manually build the minimal rustdoc to trigger the issue). However, and maybe no one can help here since it's so old, building <code>./x.py --stage=1 src/tools/rustdoc src/libstd</code> takes well over an hour (seems to get stuck on building core). Any idea why that might be the case, or what I can check (config.toml or otherwise) to speed that up? I'll have this running while I work so it's not a big deal if it takes a long time.</p>",
