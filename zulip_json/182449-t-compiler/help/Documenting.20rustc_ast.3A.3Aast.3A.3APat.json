(Not sure in this qualifies as a 'topic' on here, but...)</p>\n<p>I noticed that this struct <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_ast/ast.rs#L515\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_ast/ast.rs#L515</a> is undocumented. Would it make sense to describe this as \"A pattern is a syntax element for matching against the structure of types\"? This is close to how the the book describes patterns <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-00-patterns.html\">https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-00-patterns.html</a>. Does it make sense in this context?</p>",
