That would be about <code>2021-12-01</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hey,<br>\nso cargo bisect didn't help at all, it didn't find anything and always reported error when I set <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> flags. But thanks for pointing out that stable was at some point nightly. Should've realized myself.</p>\n<p>Aaanyway I've found the culprit and it might be what you linked. When I try to build it with nightly-2021-12-08 it takes so long I've never seen it finished. But for nightly-2021-12-22 (which should be with merged PR you linked) it finishes in 5m.</p>\n<p>Thanks again for help. I feel much more smarter now :D</p>",
