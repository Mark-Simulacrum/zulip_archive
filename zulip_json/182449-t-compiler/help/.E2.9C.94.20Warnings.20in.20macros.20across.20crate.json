Overall the experience was pretty good; Rust language helps a lot for understanding even sparsely commented code; even the “if-it-compiles-then-it-works” was almost true for me, too. (Ultimately, I only stumbled over a small minor problem that HIR visitors were a bit underdocumented in terms of what they visit in what mode. Fixed that documentation, too, now. The only other test failure was a new, previously undiscovered, unused <code>unsafe</code> block in rustc itself :D)</p>\n<p>MIR could be documented better, I feel like after rustc-dev-guide I still had to look at the source-code of the actual data structure and some of the code that interacts with it and test mir-expansions of some code samples myself to get a more complete very-basic understanding at all e.g. about what happens to closures or what these “scopes” are about. HIR is much simpler to understand because it’s close to an ordinary AST, as documented in the Rust reference.</p>",
