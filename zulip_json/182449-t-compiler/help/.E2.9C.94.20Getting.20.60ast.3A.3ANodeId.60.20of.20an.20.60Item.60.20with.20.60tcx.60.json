I've managed to bring the <code>DefId</code>  to rustc_privacy. I'm pretty close to fixing it. Main issue is, the way I do it for now, I get the <code>import.id</code> (<a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_resolve/imports/struct.Import.html\">https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_resolve/imports/struct.Import.html</a>) and get a <code>DefId</code> from it but it only fixes \"half\" the issue. One <code>NodeId</code> generates two <code>DefId</code> (one for the type NS and for the value NS). The issue specified to pass a <code>NodeId</code> to rustc_privacy so I tried going back on that and that's pretty much why I'm asking this question</p>",
