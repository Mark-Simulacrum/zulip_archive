I have generated assembly files from a Rust file using a custom rustc.<br>\nHowever, LLVM 12 is not able to compile LLVM-Assembly to object or binaries for AIX (and this functionality is not planned soon). If I understand correctly, Rust produces by default LLVM-Assembly, and calls LLVM to produce object or binary. As Rust can generate native Assembly files, is there a flag to force Rust to produce native assembly and to call LLVM with this assembly file? Moreover, is there a way to specify assembler (to redirect to an AIX machine, and use, eg, GCC on AIX to transform assembly into binaries)? I have found for linker, but not for assembler.</p>",
