For some of our Rust code we live in \"no_std &lt; this space &lt; unbounded resources\" .  (Zynq-7000 type platforms, with in-memory ram disks for root file system).  When stripped release binaries start growing up toward 10MB it's a concern for us.  Crates seem to exist either in \"no_std\" or they are free to grow without bound. I would like to see a question relating to this next year to see if there are more people using Rust in low-resource systems, but not so low as to be no_std.</p>",
