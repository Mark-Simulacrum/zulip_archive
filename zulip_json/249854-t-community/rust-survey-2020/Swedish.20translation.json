The English version of the Survey has that note about the google survey engine having a bug, so one should only click the radio buttons once.  Well, unfortunately I missed that change so it wasn't in the translation. :/  A few results have multiple entries, which I assume is a side effect of people not knowing about this glitch.  Not sure how to handle it.  How was this handled when it was first discovered?</p>",
