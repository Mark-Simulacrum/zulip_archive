The only place you are allowed to change enum representation is in the <code>layout_of</code> query. Changing the representation anywhere else will break compilation in horrible ways. Simple example: <code>size_of</code> of the enum type will differ between the way you represent the enum and the way rustc represents it. So any user code using <code>memcpy</code> or any other untyped operation just using the size will see a different picture from what you're seeing.</p>",
