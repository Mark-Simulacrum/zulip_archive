Optimizations tend to normalize things, so there will be certain kinds of MIR that just cannot exist any more e.g. after constant folding, or existing test cases might not actually run the code paths any more that they were supposed to run. Do we run these optimizations on the MIR for const/static initializers and <code>const fn</code>? Are there plans to run those tests both with and without optimizations or so?</p>",
