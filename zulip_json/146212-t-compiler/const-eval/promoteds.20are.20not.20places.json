        "content": "<p>@spastorino is working on making implicit promoteds not be a <code>mir::Place</code> anymore, but just an <code>Operand::Constant</code> by having the MIR of the promoted essentially be a reference to what used to be the value. Now the user may be writing e.g. <code>&amp;[(SOME_CELL, 42)][i].1</code> and this would get promoted, because we'd statically know that no thing with interior mutability will ever be available to the user without some serious unsafe code (probably fine in stacked borrows though, afaict).<br>\nNow this means that our promoted is actually <code>&amp;[(SOME_CELL, 42)]</code> and the MIR using it will do the <code>&amp;promoted[i].1</code> projection because the index may be a runtime value.</p>\n<p>This all works on stable right now, so we can't suddenly start erroring and figure this out later. The problem is that now there are promoteds of <code>&amp;[(Cell&lt;T&gt;, i32); 1]</code> type, which interning will correctly reject as an invalid constant. Interning did not reject this before because we had <code>[(Cell&lt;T&gt;, i32); 1]</code> which is a legal constant. The only way I see right now on how to fix this is to add a field to <code>mir::Body</code> that is read before <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/0a953cd9aa8b4c8b821bc672a4408900758e7e63/src/librustc_mir/const_eval.rs#L171\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/0a953cd9aa8b4c8b821bc672a4408900758e7e63/src/librustc_mir/const_eval.rs#L171\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/0a953cd9aa8b4c8b821bc672a4408900758e7e63/src/librustc_mir/const_eval.rs#L171</a> and passed to that function in order to make interning only validate the given projection (including all possible indices for <code>Index</code> projections).</p>\n<p>One good thing that would come out of all of this is that we can now mark any promoted's memory as immutable, even if it technically contains mutable memory (at which point miri would also detect it if the user did unsafe shenanigans to get at the cell that they don't have a pointer to).</p>\n<p>cc <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"120791\">@RalfJ</span>  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"119009\">@eddyb</span></p>",
