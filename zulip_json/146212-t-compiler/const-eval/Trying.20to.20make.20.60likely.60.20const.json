However I did have <code>#![feature(const_likely)]</code> added in src/libcore/lib.rs. Making <code>likely</code> and <code>unlikely</code> use rustc_const_stable obviously fixes this issue, but I don't think that is correct way forward even though they are currently not exposed to user.</p>\n<p>Could someone have a look of this issue?</p>",
