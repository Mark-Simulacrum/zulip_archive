So my argument here is that cranelift would possibly do less checking than miri but its a tradeoff anyway so it would not rule out a faster const eval \"backend\" directly.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This jit backend would probably be optional if it ever happened.</p>\n<p>Would like to hear thoughts on why this will not work :D</p>",

It is the responsibility of the (dynamic) linker to pick an address for every symbol (function, static or promoted value). When running code at compile time, you have to make sure that you know which parts of a memory allocation are relocations to other memory allocations/functions, so you can emit the appropriate relocations for the linker to load. When running code at runtime it is fine to just treat pointers as plain integers.</p>",
