Slides are fine but I wouldn't say required. Something I found worked really well is to create a DropBox paper, work out the rough plan of what you want to say, and then make a fresh dropbox paper for the talk -- then you can just type stuff into it as you go, sort of leaving notes behind, but notes that can be collaboratively updated. (Plus then we can link to the final dropbox paper with the talk, so people can peruse at their leisure) But that may or may not work for this particular material.</p>",

I'm trying to make this seem a bit more official!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>[miri]  is an interpreter for MIR, Rust's internal representation. miri is the foundation for Rust's compile time evaluation capabilities. Its design enables it to simulate the workings of the machine at a low-level, meaning that it can interpret not only \"safe Rust\" but also a lot of unsafe Rust code, including complex and highly optimized libraries like the stdlib hashmap. In this talk, compiler team member oli-obk will dig into how miri works, giving us some insight into its architecture, the way that it represents and reasons about memory, and what kinds of capabilities it offers for Rust itself.</p>\n<p>[miri]: <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/miri\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/miri\">https://github.com/rust-lang/miri</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>OK, I totally made up that set of things you would talk about.
