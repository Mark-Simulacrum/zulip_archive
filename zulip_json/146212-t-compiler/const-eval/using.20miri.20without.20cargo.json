        "content": "<p>Hi, I have a project where I use my own test suite harness (think compile-test but less clever). I'd like to run these tests under miri but from what I can see, cargo-miri assumes that binaries are known by cargo (either via <code>[[bin]]</code> in <code>Cargo.toml</code> or by existing in <code>src/bin/</code>. Instead, we just have a large dir of independent source files, a bit like the <code>test/</code> dir in rustc. Is it possible to setup and compile things for miri using <code>rustc</code> so that my own test harness (and not cargo-miri)  can compile each target independently and dispatch it to <code>cargo-miri run</code>? Thanks!</p>",

Unfortunately I have quite a lot of crates that would need manually compiling with the driver this way that it's not really feasible.
