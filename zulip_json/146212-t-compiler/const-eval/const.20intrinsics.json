This is one of the first time's I've ever really touched code that deals with stdlib, so I have no idea what I'm doing. It looks like the intrinsics need to be const-stable, despite the fact that they are themselves unstable? How difficult is that to do, given that the rest of the PR is quite trivial?</p>",
