E.g.:</p>\n<p><code>tcx.layout_of(ty).field(..)</code></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, <code>Layout::field</code> requires a cx <code>C: LayoutOf</code> which I don't seem to have access to as nullary intrinsics are evaluated without an <code>InterpCx</code>. Is there a workaround here? Perhaps some empty cx that I can pass in? I'm not even sure why the <code>field()</code> method needs a cx here, but that's because I'm very unfamiliar with this part of the compiler. Thanks</p>",
