We had been scanning functions for #[test] attributes and then running them, but now #[test] is a macro that puts a pointer to the actual test inside a <code>test::TestDescAndFn</code> structure. see <a href=\"https://github.com/solson/miri/issues/479\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/solson/miri/issues/479\">https://github.com/solson/miri/issues/479</a> . This means for miri to run it, it needs to pull the struct apart to find the function pointer then run that. with the existing APIs that i'm aware of, this is pretty difficult to do programmatically without deeply-nested matches or something</p>",
