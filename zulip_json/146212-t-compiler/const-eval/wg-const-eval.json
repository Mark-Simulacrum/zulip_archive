It even has its own de facto <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-rfcs/const-eval\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-rfcs/const-eval\">git repo</a>. As discussed in <a href=\"https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2019/10/11/Lang-Team-Meeting.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2019/10/11/Lang-Team-Meeting.html\">last week's lang-team meeting</a>, I think const-eval should be promoted <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-263a\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span> to a <a href=\"https://rust-lang.github.io/compiler-team/procedures/form-new-working-group/#step-1-propose-the-working-group\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://rust-lang.github.io/compiler-team/procedures/form-new-working-group/#step-1-propose-the-working-group\">proper working group</a>.</p>\n<p>There's been some developments in const-eval recently, and an official working group would help to communicate these developments to the compiler team as well as the broader community. I've been working on improving static validation of const bodies to enable <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/49146\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/49146\">#49146</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/52000\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/52000\">#52000</a> and (in the distant future) <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57349\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57349\">#57349</a>, and others have been working on the MIRI side, including adding checks to ensure that the static validation is sound.</p>\n<p>I think this hasn't been done in the past because migrating/creating a repo, scheduling meetings and writing progress summaries is not very fun, and most of the stakeholders have a lot of other responsibilities on the rust project and elsewhere. I'm relatively new here, I'm not a compiler team member and I don't have a good understanding of the inner workings of MIRI, but I would be willing to take on some of these organizational tasks, including generating the weekly report to the compiler team. However, I think <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"124288\">@oli</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"120791\">@RalfJ</span> should be the co-leads for this WG.</p>\n<p>We should also try to have a <a href=\"#narrow/stream/146212-t-compiler.2Fconst-eval/topic/Weekly.20check-in.3F\" title=\"#narrow/stream/146212-t-compiler.2Fconst-eval/topic/Weekly.20check-in.3F\">weekly scheduled meeting</a>.</p>",
