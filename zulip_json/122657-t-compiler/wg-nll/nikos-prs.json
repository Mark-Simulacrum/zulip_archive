My question is, would you rather just look at #51460 directly, even though it's long? It also has some \"extra commits\" that did refactorings I didn't always wind up using later — I could plausibly pull those out, but I'm not sure I want to invest the time (and I do expect to use the refactorings later on)</p>",
