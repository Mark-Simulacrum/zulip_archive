They only way i was able to was to enable <code>nll</code> on nightly.<br>\nI guess I have two questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Is there a way I could make it compile on stable? Its really a minimized version of a more complicated code, I know it looks like a contrived example, but that's what I managed to reproduce as a minimalist example.</li>\n<li>Is nll getting stabilized any time soon?</li>\n</ol>",
