Basically, I want to tie a bow on the current NLL system and move on to a different project, but certainly others are working on Polonius and I believe @nikomatsakis intends to either steer that ship themself or find someone else to pilot it in. Its our current best hope for getting NLL to its idealized state.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, who is working on Polonius so that I might follow the exciting progress?</p>",
