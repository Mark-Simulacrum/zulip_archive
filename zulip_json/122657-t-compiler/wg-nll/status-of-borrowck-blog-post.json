You can <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/nikomatsakis/74e541ec03e6b777040a8fb8ad6a2580\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://gist.github.com/nikomatsakis/74e541ec03e6b777040a8fb8ad6a2580\">see the draft in this gist</a>. I'd love to get some feedback on the content, but I'm really writing because I realized at the end that I think we could/should maybe do a bit more to make it easy to figure out how to \"hop in\" and contribute. I'm not sure what to suggest, really? GitHub issues are an option, though I worry about notifications getting lost there — it's increasingly hard to keep up, at least for me  personally. Coming to the meeting is an option, but it won't work for all -- should we have an internals thread that we actually keep up to date? Rely on people to read the backlog? Not sure, would appreciate thoughts.</p>",
