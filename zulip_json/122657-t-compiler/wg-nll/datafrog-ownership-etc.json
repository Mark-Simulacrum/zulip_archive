I've been thinking about moving more and more of rustc out into crates (polonius and chalk are examples of this, but also lesser things like ena, our hashtables, etc) that can live in the <code>rust-lang-nursery</code>org (or rust-lang, not important) as well as being on <code>crates.io</code>. In general, my preference is that if rustc depends on something, we have some people in the rust org (hopefully teams!) with write permissions, so we can patch bugs, issues <a href=\"http://crates.io\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a> releases, etc. I'm not sure where I think datafrog ought to live though =) my guess is that maybe it deserves its own Github org (sort of like LALRPOP) and we can try to ensure that members of the compiler team are actively involved in maintenance (my other guess is that, like ena, it will settle eventually and not need much). I definitely think datafrog is a tool that can be useful in many parts of the compiler and likely outside the compiler as well. Anyway, I don't have a firm idea, just trying to think things through a bit.</p>",
