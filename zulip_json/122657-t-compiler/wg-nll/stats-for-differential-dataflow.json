Maybe we should alter the <code>-z</code> stats option to gather up internal statistics about the differential-dataflow computation itself (<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116013\">@qmx</span> this might be nice \"in road\" for playing around with it; <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116113\">@lqd</span> you might enjoy too). The idea would be fairly simple: we would insert the <code>count</code> operations at strategic points and dump out the results, trying to get a feel for how many tuples are flowing around at each point. I'm not sure that the <code>hist</code> package is very useful for this, though, we'd probably want to dump the results more in tabular form.</p>",
