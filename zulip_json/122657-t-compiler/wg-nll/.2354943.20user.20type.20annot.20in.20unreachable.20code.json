So far, I've tried:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(monday) Naive first attempt at refactor into <code>IndexVec</code> w/out visiting place - ICE due to renumbering being skipped.</li>\n<li>(wednesday) Refactor into <code>IndexVec</code>, storing a <code>Location</code> into the vec too so that I can <code>visit_place</code> - caused some strange ICE, think it was related to the ugly way I had to create a <code>Location</code> that anticipated the location of the statement that was about to be inserted.</li>\n<li>(today) Refactor into <code>IndexVec</code>, removing the statement entirely, iterating over the vec after normal type check visitor. Still can't visit the place to renumber, so manually call the renumbering code on the <code>Ty&lt;'tcx&gt;</code> inside the <code>Place&lt;'tcx&gt;</code> - feels close but can't easily get a mutable reference to the <code>Ty&lt;'tcx&gt;</code> like you get from the visitor, so still ICEs due to renumbering even though I'm calling the renumbering code.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've not yet tried moving the place back into the statement so that it can be visited when the statement is visited - that'd solve the renumbering issue, but I'm unsure how it would solve the issue of user type annotations not being checked in dead code since those statements with less in them could still be removed.</p>",

I've got that compiling and running, but I get a few ICEs that I'm not quite sure about. It definitely makes some of the code changes to type check related to this issue easier.</p>\n<p>To do that, I'm needing to modify where the <code>Ty&lt;'tcx&gt;</code> and <code>UserSubsts&lt;'tcx&gt;</code> were initially being canonicalized in <code>librustc_typeck</code>. Instead of canonicalizing a <code>UserSubsts&lt;'tcx&gt;</code> and storing that so that it can later be put into a <code>UserTypeAnnotation&lt;'tcx&gt;</code>, I'm now making a <code>UserTypeAnnotation&lt;'tcx&gt;</code> at that point and canonicalizing that so it can later be used when building the <code>Mir</code>. I'm not thrilled that I'm needing to use that <code>rustc::mir</code> type in <code>rustc_typeck</code> because I figured we'd want to keep a separation there, but I don't know how else to get around that.</p>\n<p>Anyway, this is mostly working - I've got it compiling with around 100 or so tests failing due to an ICE. I get this logging on a build without the change applied:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>DEBUG 2018-11-21T00:36:33Z: rustc_typeck::check: write_user_substs_from_substs(HirId { owner: DefIndex(0:15), local_id: ItemLocalId(12) }, [_]) in fcx 0x7fff8ef5e150\nDEBUG 2018-11-21T00:36:33Z: rustc_typeck::check: instantiate_value_path: user_substs = Canonical { max_universe: U0, variables: [CanonicalVarInfo { kind: Ty(General) }], value: UserSubsts { substs: [^0], user_self_ty: None } }\nDEBUG 2018-11-21T00:36:33Z: rustc_typeck::check: write_user_substs(HirId { owner: DefIndex(0:15), local_id: ItemLocalId(12) }, Canonical { max_universe: U0, variables: [CanonicalVarInfo { kind: Ty(General) }], value: UserSubsts { substs: [^0], user_self_ty: None } }) in fcx 0x7fff8ef5e150\nDEBUG 2018-11-21T00:36:33Z: rustc_typeck::check: write_user_substs: skipping identity substs\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>So that logging is with a <code>UserSubsts&lt;'tcx&gt;</code> being canonicalized.

Either way, the <code>is_identity</code> function is now returning <code>true</code> (due to the change from <code>^0</code> to <code>?0</code> - though I don't know what these represent) and that annotation isn't being skipped as it should be.</p>",
