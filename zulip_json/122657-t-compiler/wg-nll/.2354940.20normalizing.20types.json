This sometimes introduces region variables which then get converted to <code>'?0</code> (because it's an inference variable). I'm not sure the best fix yet. The first thing I thought is to stop normalizing in <code>AstConv</code> and push the normalizations so they occur later (I think that should be fine...?) but I'm a bit afraid of subtle interactions. It's always hard to ensure everything is normalized.</p>\n<p>Another thought I had is to leave this unfixed and push harder on lazy normalization (which we are also working on over in <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"144729\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/144729-wg-traits\">#wg-traits</a>)</p>",
