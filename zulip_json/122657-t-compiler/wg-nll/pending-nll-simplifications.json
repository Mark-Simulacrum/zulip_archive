One of the things it does is to remove the <code>universal_regions</code> facts and instead just add more <code>region_live_at</code> facts.</p>\n<p>In particular, each universal region (e.g., a named lifetime parameter) is always live over the entire CFG. Before, I didn't add those facts explicitly, but instead had a <code>universal_region(R)</code> fact that then had to be accounted for in the rules separately. This was a pain in the neck and kind of a micro-optimization that — I think — made no difference. In the optimized rules, in fact, I <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/borrow-check/blob/4945c130cb1f3af7c072dc9856b6fe21b3a9f1f7/src/output/timely_opt.rs#L29-L41\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/borrow-check/blob/4945c130cb1f3af7c072dc9856b6fe21b3a9f1f7/src/output/timely_opt.rs#L29-L41\">manually expanded the <code>universal_region</code> facts into <code>region_live_at</code> facts</a> to simplify my life. So I've just moved that into the compiler.</p>",
