By quickly glancing at the linked issues and the linked thread on the users forum, my (admittedly limited) understanding is that this is not  something that be very easily \"fixed\", it's kind of how these architectures work. I think OP is just asking to put a sort of \"safeguard\". Happy to receive more insights on this issue.</p>\n<p>In short, given there's also a list of linked issues around the same theme that seem not to be critical, I'd warrant a <code>P-medium</code> (if not <code>P-low</code>).</p>",

This is a property of the language, not of the architecture (it just happens to only occur on AVR). I'm ok with P-low based on the linked issues, but I would prefer to have it I-nominated I think so it has more eyes on it.</p>",
