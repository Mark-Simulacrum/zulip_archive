On stable, the error is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>expected <code>&amp;Location&lt;'_&gt;</code>, found <code>&amp;Location&lt;'_&gt;</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>but nightly (maybe beta too now), shows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>expected <code>(&amp;Location&lt;'_&gt;,)</code>, found <code>(&amp;Location&lt;'_&gt;,)</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>which I find quite weird. The error is weird enough as it is since it shows two things that are equal, but it's even weirder that it has changed to showing tuples on nightly. I'm guessing the reason the two things look equal but are not is because of constraints on inference variables? I don't know enough about the type-checker to know for sure though.</p>",
