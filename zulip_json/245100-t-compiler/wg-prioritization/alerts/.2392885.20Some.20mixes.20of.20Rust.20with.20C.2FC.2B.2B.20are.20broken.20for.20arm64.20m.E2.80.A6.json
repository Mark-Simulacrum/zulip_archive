Even with PAuth (etc) turned off, both would generate conflicting override flags (since <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88354\">#88354</a>, until reverted in <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/93523\">#93523</a>).

It only matters with LTO, because as far as I know that's the only situation where LLVM IR modules are merged.</p>\n<p>Reverting for beta is quite reasonable, anyway.</p>",
