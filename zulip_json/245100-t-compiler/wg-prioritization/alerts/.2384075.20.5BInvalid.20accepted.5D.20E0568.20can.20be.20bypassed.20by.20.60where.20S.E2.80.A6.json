At a cursory look, it seems to proceed slowly, so I thought a <code>P-medium</code> for this issue?<br>\nMy rationale is: even if we assign a <code>P-high</code> it would be blocked anyway by <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/13231\">#13231</a>. So I'd say a <code>P-medium</code> to keep it on the radar<br>\n(makes sense?)</p>",
