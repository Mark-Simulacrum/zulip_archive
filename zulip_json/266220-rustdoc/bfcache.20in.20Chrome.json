This is particularly noticeable if you navigate with back/forward to a search results page. Previously Chrome would have to recalculate the search, which was noticeably slow.</p>\n<p>We don't have to do anything to take advantage of it - several months ago I fixed a small issue that was preventing us from getting bfcached on Firefox, and it looks like it's paid off for Chrome as well. If you use Chrome, make sure you're on latest and enjoy the newfound speed! :-D</p>",
