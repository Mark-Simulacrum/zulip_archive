I just wanted to double check that was understood.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/4715/oLuVKF23RmOhOqReatHSH7A4/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/4715/oLuVKF23RmOhOqReatHSH7A4/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/4715/oLuVKF23RmOhOqReatHSH7A4/image.png\"></a></div>",
