I'm still not 100% sure what it means. It seems like an important concept in maintaining the HTML for rustdoc though. Maybe we can settle on a definition and add it to <a href=\"https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/rustdoc-internals.html\">https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/rustdoc-internals.html</a> ?</p>",

One good definition would be \"a docblock contains words written by the doc author (in markdown).\" But the type-decl uses the <code>docblock</code> class, and doesn't contain words written by the doc author.</p>\n<p>I guess what I'm getting at is that we should remove the <code>docblock</code> class from type-decl, and style it directly as <code>.type-decl</code> with whatever styles it then winds up missing.</p>",
