Not sure what is going wrong, the only output is <code>status: signal: 13</code> aka <code>SIGPIPE</code>. Example of such a failure: <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang-ci/rust/runs/1738335854\">https://github.com/rust-lang-ci/rust/runs/1738335854</a></p>\n<p>Not sure what the problem is, but it's always on this specific test.</p>\n<p>The only thing this test does, is checking that <code>--test-builder true</code> works. Apparently that causes some race condition with pipes when used in the test suite.</p>",
