We don't really have a coherent plan. Some places we wrap; others we allow overflow (almost always a bug); others we have a scrollbar, and others we truncate (with an ellipsis).</p>\n<p>I propose that our default should be that everything can wrap, even if that means breaking a word (<code>overflow-wrap: break-word</code>). The one exception should be for code examples, which should get a horizontal scrollbar.</p>",
