Specifically when you define a macro in a submodule, and then you export that submodule via <code>pub use</code>, the macro definition does not show up in the generated docs. Non-macro items show up as expected, and the behavior doesn't manifest if the submodule is just directly exported via <code>pub mod</code> rather than via <code>pub use</code>.</p>",
