I found a really great demonstration of one of the problems with them: the Wayback Machine's calendar selector, e.g. <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20170101000000*/https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/third-party-revocation-updates\">https://web.archive.org/web/20170101000000*/https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/third-party-revocation-updates</a></p>\n<p>Find a date that has a circle on it, like Aug 9. Click that circle. What happens? First, the little popup appears, because you hovered. When you click, it disappears, because the popup is also activated / deactivated on click (presumably for accessibility / mobile friendliness). I think this UI would be better if it implemented only click or only hover. And between the two it should be click. A useful lesson for our own UI designs, I think.</p>",
