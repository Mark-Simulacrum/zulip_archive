One proposal is to show it only on hover of the code sample. I'd like to do that. Thoughts?</p>\n<p>As always, hover is not a thing on mobile, but I am particularly motivated to hide the button on mobile because it often obscures the code sample itself. See this example from String::with_capacity where, despite scrolling all the way to the right, I can't see the full example because of the \"Run\" button. I think non-visibility of \"Run\" on mobile is a good tradeoff for removing this barrier to reading the code samples.</p>\n<p>Also worth noting that on iOS a tap event generates \"hover\" then \"click\", so I think on iOS we would actually show the \"Run\" button after tapping the code sample.</p>",
