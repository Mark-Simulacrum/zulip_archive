There's an issue open for fix it (for almost 5 years now): <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/31387\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/31387</a>. Some of the suggestions were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use smaller names in the JSON keys</li>\n<li>Use a binary format</li>\n<li>Somehow load the information lazily instead of eagerly</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think \"use a binary format\" is the simplest, and should also have a big effect on the file size and load time. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"210316\">@GuillaumeGomez</span> what do you think? Do you have suggestions for a format?</p>",
