We could have a \"rustdoc reading meeting\" where team members (and maybe regular contributors too) meet to read different parts of the code. Then, people who are \"expert\" in those areas can help people who are less knowledgeable understand the code.</p>\n<p>This is kind of what I was hoping for from the rustc reading club, but that has somewhat different goals. This meeting would be explicitly focused on people who are already knowledgeable about rustdoc but are missing knowledge about certain parts. That way we can review more PRs and don't have to just rely on one or two people who know that code well.</p>",
