This means I usually need to make my own or link to the crates somewhere else. It would be nice if Rustdoc generated an index.html that had a list of the crates generated. For how it would look, I was thinking it would be just the <a href=\"http://docs.rs\">docs.rs</a> homepage but a list of local crates. </p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/4715/N5Yt6jjz_yktlaDKx-71um0q/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-22.59.39.png\">Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-22.59.39.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/4715/N5Yt6jjz_yktlaDKx-71um0q/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-22.59.39.png\" title=\"Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-22.59.39.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/4715/N5Yt6jjz_yktlaDKx-71um0q/Screenshot-2021-09-15-at-22.59.39.png\"></a></div>",
