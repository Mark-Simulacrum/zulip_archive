I dug into this a bit in <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/85418\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/85418</a>. The Foreign Implementors are (by necessity) rendered by JS. That means their rendering is often out of sync with the rendering of Local Implementors. Also the distinction between (unmarked) Foreign Implementors and Implementations on Foreign Types is very confusing.</p>\n<p>I propose that traits should have three sections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Local Implementations on Foreign Types</li>\n<li>Local Implementors</li>\n<li>Foreign Implementors</li>\n</ul>",
