You can also see a very nice example if you look at the CSS for <a href=\"https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/\">https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/</a> (ideally after playing a couple of words).</p>\n<p>The idea is we would define semantic names like <code>--foreground: black</code> on the root element, and themes can override it with e.g. <code>--foreground: white</code>. So instead of having to override a bunch of rules, they override just a few variables.</p>",
