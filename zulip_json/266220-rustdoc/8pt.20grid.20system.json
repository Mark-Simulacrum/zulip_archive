This article was really good: <a href=\"https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/built-to-adapt/intro-to-the-8-point-grid-system-2\">https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/built-to-adapt/intro-to-the-8-point-grid-system-2</a></p>\n<p>It introduces the notion of aligning sizes and spacing to a consistent 8 point (pixel) grid.</p>\n<p>This sentence in particular caught my eye:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is because reaching an aesthetically pleasing composition to the overall page is difficult to consistently create. I can use my design eye to nudge a few elements here or there but I canâ€™t rely on a team of designers and developers to share my same vision. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think rustdoc has a lot of that - various developers at various times nudging elements, sometimes with feedback from reviewers, and usually with a focus on a very specific part of the page. Adopting an 8 point grid would be a nice way to add some consistency in a way that anyone who works on the project can readily build on. That doesn't mean everything has to be 100% grid aligned all the time. The article also describes \"soft grids\" and \"hard grids\" as ways to talk about how strictly you adhere to them.</p>",
