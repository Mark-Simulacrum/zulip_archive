You objected to \"collapse\" so I backed out the change to be discussed later. Let's discuss it now. :-) Also cc <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"210316\">@GuillaumeGomez</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"307537\">@Noah Lev</span> who liked the text variant.</p>\n<p>If I can try to restate your objections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The \"collapse all\" item acts like a button. It changes the current page; it doesn't navigate to another page. So it should be styled like a button.</li>\n<li><code>[-]</code> is fewer characters than \"collapse\"</li>\n<li>\"collapse\" doesn't match the <code>[-]</code> / <code>[+]</code> buttons elsewhere on the page.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'd like to propose the text be <code>summary</code> / <code>details</code>. That conveys more of the concept of \"this link takes you to a summary page (even if we achieve that by manipulating the current page).\" Also I think someday we may actually want to make the summary its own page, which would allow us more flexibility in what we display.</p>\n<p>It's true that <code>[-]</code> is fewer characters, but what we're aiming for is not fewer characters but clarity of hierarchy and clear direction of attention. Right now the <code>[-]</code> in \"1.0.0 · source · [-]\" stands out like a sore thumb. That draws attention to it, when the first place we want to draw people's attention is the item title <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, and then down through the docs. On desktop we're not short on space in this position, and as of <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/92861\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/92861</a>, we make appropriate room for it on the next line down.</p>\n<p>It will still be true that \"summary\" doesn't look like the <code>[-]</code> / <code>[+]</code> buttons, but I think that's okay. Assuming we switch to ‣ (maybe, maybe not), it would be confusing to have one of those up top, since the visual meaning of that icon is \"this will collapse things immediately to its right and below.\" The \"summary\" link is a different operation, since it collapses many things.</p>\n<p>What do you think?</p>",
