Once that lands we'll have 7 properties across 4 rules fixing up problems from normalize, out of about 33 rules we get from normalize total.</p>\n<p>I'd like to get the unminified version of normalize (<a href=\"https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/8.0.1/normalize.css\">https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/8.0.1/normalize.css</a>), copy it inline into rustdoc.css, and then start deleting the bogus rules as well as our overrides.</p>\n<p>This will very slightly reduce the total size of our CSS. It will be one less resource to be loaded on the blocking path by browsers. And it will give us a path to whittle down the normalize rules and maybe eventually get rid of any we don't need. One downside is that once we start inline editing like that it would be hard to pick up updates. But normalize was last updated 3 years ago; I don't expect any new updates.</p>",
