In my PR I consolidate on a single way, <code>rem</code>. That's better than <code>em</code> because it solves a problem called \"compounding\" (if an element of font-size 1.5em is inside an element of font-size 1.5em, the actual size is 2.25 times the document base size). That's better than <code>px</code> because it respects the user's setting for font-size, which some people set larger or smaller for accessibility or preference reasons.</p>\n<p>Note that this is distinct from the \"Zoom\" (Ctrl-+ / Ctrl--) functionality on many (but not all) browsers.</p>\n<p>If folks like this I propose to set a rule that font sizes should always be specified in <code>rem</code>, with a small carveout for icon fonts, which should be specified in <code>px</code>.</p>",
