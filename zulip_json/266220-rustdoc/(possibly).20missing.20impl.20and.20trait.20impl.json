On the online rustdoc for rustc, I find both <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir/def_id/struct.LocalDefId.html\">LocalDefId</a>'s and <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir/def_id/struct.DefId.html\">DefId</a>'s implementations (i.e., methods on the sidebar) and field implementations are possibly missing. By clicking the source code button (<a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/src/rustc_span/def_id.rs.html#329-331\">LocalDefId's source</a> and <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/src/rustc_span/def_id.rs.html#227-236\">DefId's source</a>),  we can find they actually have some implementations and field implementations. Is there any specific reasons why this happen?</p>",
