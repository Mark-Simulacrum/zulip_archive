It's a commonplace in graphic design, but not much supported by research. What studies there have been showed insignificant difference between the two.</p>\n<p>So my default thought is to leave it alone, since change is likely to upset people and there's not a specific benefit.</p>\n<p>_However_, I've been thinking about cross-site consistency in the Rust ecosystem lately, and I noticed <a href=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a>, <a href=\"http://rust-lang.org\">rust-lang.org</a>, <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/\">The Book</a>, and <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/\">The Reference</a> all use sans serif fonts for body text. Being consistent with other Rust sites might be a good reason to switch.</p>",
