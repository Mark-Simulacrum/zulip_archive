In it you said you didn't care for always underlining the links, but I'd like to bring this up in case you weren't aware. There is a <code>text-decoration-color</code> property in CSS, so you could do <code>text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #fff5;</code> for the <code>.example-wrap &gt; pre.rust a</code> and <code>text-decoration-color: #fff;</code> for <code>.example-wrap &gt; pre.rust a:hover</code>, with the font color naturally varying from the theme. I just tried this in my browser and I think it looks decent â€” not too distracting but still clear that it's a link. This remains the case even in link-dense code. <a href=\"/user_uploads/4715/2-MWH6xmynL_Gatzgk6OvpuG/Screenshot-from-2021-08-08-01-13-03.png-57-658585\">example</a></p>",
