The feature suggested is something I've wanted before, so I started looking into it. The implementation is very easy; figuring out the design and placement on the type's page is the tricky part. I've got this so far:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/4715/8g869he7Ql8m45yx1qb1BuUp/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/4715/8g869he7Ql8m45yx1qb1BuUp/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/4715/8g869he7Ql8m45yx1qb1BuUp/image.png\"></a></div><p>However, I don't think we'd want to put layout information at the top of the page since it's auxiliary. I was thinking maybe we could put it at the bottom of the page, but I suspect not many people scroll past auto trait impls etc. But at least the info would be there.</p>\n<p>What do you all think?</p>",
