As far as I am concerned, I feel that my skills in Rust (or lack thereof) are the limiting factor, Emacs certainly does not get in the way. But the game changer for me was using <code>rust-analyzer</code>, I feel much more at ease when writing code, it's a godsend.<br>\nMy topmost used feature is the type hinting. I used to provoke compiler error on purpose to understand what some function parameter  was expected to be, or what a certain function returned <span aria-label=\"laughing\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f606\" role=\"img\" title=\"laughing\">:laughing:</span> <br>\nClearly, learning Emacs is not easy. You might also have a look at Spacemacs (that's an alternative version of Emacs, more \"vim-like\") and install LSP there</p>",
