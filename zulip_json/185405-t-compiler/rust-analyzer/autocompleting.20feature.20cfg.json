If i were to implement this im confused on a couple of things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>how do i get the current crate's available features? i found something in the package crate but i found no way to get the actual package</li>\n<li>RA doesnt autocomplete strings, no? so how would i autocomplete in this case?</li>\n</ul>",

Ive done plenty of error tolerant parsing with rowan but parsing from existing tokens is... weird. Because we can't build a rowan node for this because there is no syntax kind that is appropriate for this AFAIK. So im not sure what approach to take, ideally we would build a tree, modify it in place, then write it back, so we dont need to write an entire cfg serializer</p>",
