I want to try to implement it , but its name resolution is so strange that I don't know how we could handle it properly : </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The local_inner_macros modifier resolves all macro invocations made from within that macro as macros in the same crate. So if info! expands to an invocation of log! then this would be resolved as $crate::log! rather than requiring the caller to have log in scope.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Copy from <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/log/pull/288\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/log/pull/288\">https://github.com/rust-lang/log/pull/288</a>)</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"133169\">@matklad</span>  Any idea ?</p>",
