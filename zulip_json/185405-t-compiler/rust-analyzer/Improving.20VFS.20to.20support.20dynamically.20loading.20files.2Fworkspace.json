For this, it was said that some improvements to VFS need to happen. I read through the source code of the ra_vfs crate. As a next step, I'd like to know if there are any work planned or already being work to improve VFS? Should I try and start tinkering locally, thinking about the changes needed and send some strawman pull requests or do you think some centralized discussion about how to go with it are beneficial?</p>",
