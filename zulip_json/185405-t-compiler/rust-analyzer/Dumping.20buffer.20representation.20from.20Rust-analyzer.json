I'm implementing incremental sync for neovim, and was hoping to use rust-analyzer to test whether we are sending the correct ranges. I can't seem to find in which crate the actual handler for textDocument/didChange is found (tried searching the rust-analyzer org via GH search, rust-analyzer itself, and several crates).  I'd like to dump the internal representation of the buffer to a file on each change notification so that I can compare our client to what rust-analyzer believes we have sent.</p>",
