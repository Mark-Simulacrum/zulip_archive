Anyways, for some reason, VSC doesnt seem to give autocompletions right after i click on a function completion. This seems to be a recurring issue when RA auto-selects something for you when completing, for example, auto-selecting parameter names so you can change them. I have to click out of the selection and go back to it for it to actually give me completions. For example:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">foo</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">ba</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"n\">foo</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">bar</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">baz</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"c1\">// baz is selected</span>\n<span class=\"n\">foo</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">bar</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">&amp;</span><span class=\"n\">b</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"c1\">// selected baz is replaced with &amp;b and does not have any autocompletions</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I was not able to find any VSC issue on this, perhaps i looked it up wrong, but any help would be appreciated <span aria-label=\"heart\" class=\"emoji emoji-2764\" role=\"img\" title=\"heart\">:heart:</span></p>",
