I've had to implement a shitton of annoying stuff around VScode integration, and also source-mapping from the user's selection to Rust program nodes. These are largely solved problems in RA, so I would love to build on RA instead. But I can't use RA  b/c I need the MIR for key facts of the analysis (e.g. lifetimes / outlives).</p>\n<p>How likely is it that RA would support MIR within the next year? Either b/c rustc adopts RA infrastructure or vice versa.</p>",
