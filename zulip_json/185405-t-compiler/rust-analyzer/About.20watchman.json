As far as I can remember, you had mentioned using <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/watchman\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/facebook/watchman\">watchman</a> instead of notify which is the cause for a bug in macOS. It seems there's a <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/watchman_client\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://crates.io/crates/watchman_client\">rust binding available</a> of the client library. Should we use it? Or you have other approach?<br>\nSorry for the noise!</p>",
