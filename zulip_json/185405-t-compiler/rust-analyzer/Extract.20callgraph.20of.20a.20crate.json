I searched before, and didn't found one. But since I have some free time, I could build it myself! The pipeline is relatively simple:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>extract the fully qualified name of all functions/methods declared in the crate.</li>\n<li>create an hyperlink to the documentation of said function.</li>\n<li>extract from the AST/IR/â€¦? the fully qualified name of all called functions. Ideally also extract all Fn, Trait parameters and other means to inject function dependencies<ul>\n<li>create a graph of dependencies, export it with graphviz</li>\n<li>displays the graph</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"232545\">@Joshua Nelson</span> told me that I could write a <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_ast/visit/trait.Visitor.html\"><code>Visitor</code></a> that only looks at functions. He also told me that I can take a look at <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_interface/util/struct.ReplaceBodyWithLoop.html\"><code>ReplaceBodyWithLoop</code></a> as an example. More specifically, apparently what I need is <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.TyCtxt.html#method.body_owners\"><code> tcx.hir().krate().body_ids</code></a> to be able to look at each function body one at at time. </p>\n<p>My question is: how do I write my <code>main()</code>? More specifically, how do I build that <code>tcx</code>?</p>",
