I wonder how we actually go about doing that :)</p>\n<p>What I like about current situation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>separation between <code>ra_hir</code> and <code>ra_ide_api</code> (we should rename it to use <code>ra_ide</code>): ide layer does a ton of stuff on top of hir, and doesn't care at all about incricate details of type inference.</li>\n<li>OO-style API for code model feels neat (the way ExprIds need to be threaded via <code>SourceAnalyzer</code> spoils a picture a bit, but presumably this can be fixed)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What I dislike about this solution is that OO interface forces everything to hang of of defs, which makes things harder to split. (like, if we split nameres and type inference, where would <code>struct Function</code> live? What about <code>Function::signature</code>?)</p>\n<p>What is good for factoring is the db API: <code>db.body(def)</code>, <code>db.ty(def)</code>, where it seems like we can have a crate which only defines IDs, and than a bunch of analysis crates, which add various <em>methods</em> to the ids via different DBs.</p>\n<p>I wonder if we should split <code>ra_hir</code></p>\n<p>into </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>ra_hir -- OO facade\n  hir_ids (defines defs and `Body`)\n  hir_lower ( provides `DefDatabase` over hir_ids)\n  hir_ty (provides `TyDatabase` over hir_ids by using DefDatabase)\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Note that means that, outside of hir, we will be doing <code>a_struct.fields(hir_db)</code>, while inside <code>hir_ty</code> we will be doing <code>def_db.struct_fields(a_struct)</code></p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116009\">@nikomatsakis</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"129457\">@Florian Diebold</span> what do you think about this?

        "content": "<p>Let me also write down some possible API flavors for spliting compiler databases over several crates. </p>\n<p><strong>OO-ish</strong></p>\n<p>This is how the current hir works. Every entity, such as a <code>Struct</code>, has a bunch of methods which take a <code>&amp;db</code> arg and return some piece of data. The nice thing with this approach is that it is code-completion friendly and is easy to read. The main drawback is that inherent methods can be defined only in a single crate, so, <code>Struct::ty</code> would have to be implemented via a trait, which might bring more complexity, especially for one-off private utility methods. The second drawback is that this approach is less efficient: projecting a field out of a <code>StructData</code> requires some sort of cloning, and getting two fields out of <code>StructData</code> requires to queries for <code>StructData</code>, because they are hidden behind accessors</p>\n<p><strong>Raw Data</strong></p>\n<p>This is the simplest thing which can work in salsa, and how the code in the branch above works. Basically, every entity is just an ID without methods. To do anything, you need to <code>db.struct_data(struct_id)</code>. <code>StrcutData</code> contains local IDs, so you need to massage those to get absolute ids. The first benefit of this approach is that it's the simplest one that could work. The second benefit is that it works really well with spliting code across crate: the set of things you can do with <code>StructId</code> is different depending on whether you have a <code>DefDatabase</code> or <code>HirDatabase</code>.</p>\n<p>The two drawbacks are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it's less completion friendly and less readable. </li>\n<li>it's super unclear how to add utility functions. That is, if <code>db.crate_graph() -&gt; CrateGraph</code> is a query, then <code>crate_dependencies()</code>, which projecs some data from CrateGraph, needs to live as a free function <em>somewhere</em>, which is even less discoverable</li>\n<li>it somewhat exposes raw data representation, and might make harder to change this data repr (not sure if this is really true though, it might actually make refactoring simpler because there are fewer wrappers everywhere)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Bound Entities</strong></p>\n<p>That's somewhat of a merger beween the two approaches, where the api is <code>db.get(struct_id).fields()</code>, where <code>get</code> returns a <code>struct StructApi { db: &amp;DB, id: StructId}</code>. It seems like a brute force way to combine the benefits of the previous too approahces, but feels pretty complex to me. I don't have a good feeling about how it'll work in pratice.</p>\n<p><strong>My prefered approach</strong></p>\n<p>I think I currently lean towards rewriting everything we have in <code>hir</code> in terms of <strong>raw data</strong> approach, moving it into separate crates, and then implementing <strong>oo</strong> approach in the umbrella <code>hir</code> crate, solely as an API for IDE.</p>",
