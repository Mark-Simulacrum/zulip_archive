The fact that struct names were colored like keywords was a VSCode bug, which they just fixed, that's why nightly is better for that one: <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/97162\" title=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/97162\">https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/97162</a></p>\n<p>There are a bunch of other small issues with the textmate scopes used by semantic coloring, including the one you mentioned about fields getting colored like functions. I've proposed a PR in rust-analyzer to fix those: <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/pull/4397\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/pull/4397\">https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/pull/4397</a></p>",
