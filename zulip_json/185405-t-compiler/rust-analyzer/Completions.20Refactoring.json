Currently, the <code>completions</code> entry point calls a dozen of different completions methods and each of them check if they should apply completions or not.</p>\n<p>I thought about removing those code checks from these functions and, instead of always calling all of them, just call the ones which are needed based on the cursor position on the document. Does anyone have suggestions about it? <span aria-label=\"happy\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f600\" role=\"img\" title=\"happy\">:happy:</span></p>",
