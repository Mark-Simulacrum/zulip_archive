        "content": "<p>Hi, is there a way to get the string representation of a token type from an instance of SyntaxKind? For example, SyntaxKind::COMMA would return \",\". This is of course only possible for Tokens that will always represent the same string, so for something like IDENT it wouldn't make sense. I'm imagining something like as_str(&amp;self) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;'static str&gt;. Is there something like this available already or can I build it from some other information? <br>\nBackground of my question is that I want to explore how Rust source code could be compressed intelligently and it'd be great to know which token types always correspond to the same string in the source code. Thanks in advance!</p>",
