Maybe we could define for each native diagnostic which rustc error code corresponds to it, and then merge them on the IDE level if the rustc diagnostic is there as expected. Might be more complicated than that because of differing spans though. Or does no-one else consider this a problem? <span aria-label=\"thinking\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f914\" role=\"img\" title=\"thinking\">:thinking:</span></p>",
