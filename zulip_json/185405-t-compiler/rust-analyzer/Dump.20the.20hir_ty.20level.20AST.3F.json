This makes sense as the module is the only container that we really know about in nameres/collector.rs in ModCollector: there is no parent information attached to the functions that I can find and we can get AST references, but there is no way to dereference them (probably by design). So I need to change the input into there. I feel like this is going to be a difficult change.</p>",
