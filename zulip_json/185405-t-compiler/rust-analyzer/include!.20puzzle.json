In some sense, this is expected behavior. From a programming model point of view, <code>include!</code> is indistinguishable from a proc macro which creates the tokens out of thin air (imagine <code>proc_include</code> which does <code>std::fs::read(path).unwrap().parse::&lt;TokenStream&gt;().unwrap()</code>).</p>\n<p>From a user's perspective though, the IDE clearly should just \"see through\" this macro. I wonder if anyone has idea  about how to special case this best?</p>",
