I'm using <code>rust-analyzer</code> with <code>LanguageClient-neovim</code> and as far as I understand its workspace symbol implementation queries the language server once, and then presents everything it has returned as a fuzzy-searchable FZF buffer. The most convenient workflow here is to use an empty query and then fuzzy-search across all returned symbols. However, with <code>rust-analyzer</code> this means that only types are returned and not functions. Is there some option to make <code>rust-analyzer</code> return everything on an empty query?</p>",
