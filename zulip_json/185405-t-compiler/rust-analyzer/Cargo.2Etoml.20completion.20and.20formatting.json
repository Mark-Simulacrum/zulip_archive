If so, there's a issue that I can track or contribute to? I'm talking about code completion for sections, keys (maybe with docs/links to Cargo reference, e.g. <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-name-field\">https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-name-field</a>) and similar nice to have features. I think IntelliJ Plugin has something similar. Thanks!</p>\n<p>Edit: To be even more clear, I'm not talking about generic TOML support. Something more specialized than that.</p>",
