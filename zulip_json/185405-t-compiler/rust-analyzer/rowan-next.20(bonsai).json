This is, to the extent of my knowledge, fully sound (unlike bonsai, which is definitely unsound in layout calculation as currently written). sorbus currently publicly takes advantage of <a href=\"http://lib.rs/erasable\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://lib.rs/erasable\">erasable</a> and <a href=\"http://lib.rs/slice-dst\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://lib.rs/slice-dst\">slice-dst</a> to do the heavy <code>unsafe</code> lifting, and <a href=\"http://lib.rs/rc-borrow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://lib.rs/rc-borrow\">rc-borrow</a> for +0 Arcs in iteration. It also currently uses the <a href=\"https://github.com/cad97/str-index\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/cad97/str-index\">str-index</a> sketch from a bit back, but that can be easily changed to a vendored newtype or <a href=\"http://crates.io/crates/text_unit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://crates.io/crates/text_unit\">text_unit</a>. Additionally, it currently relies on two nightly features hopefully targeted to stabilize in 1.43 (still FCP-merge): <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/69362\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/69362\">a subset of alloc_layout_extras</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/68952\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/68952\">associated int consts</a>. The former can be shimmed trivially (I've done it before) and the latter is just an import away from not having a feature gate, but if I'm blocked on 1.43 anyway....</p>\n<p>Before I put further time into this new internals rewrite of rowan, I have a two-pronged question:</p>\n<p>1) Is sorbus the direction we should go with rowan? I find erasable/slice-dst to be a much more coherent story around custom slice DSTs than our previous approaches (thin-dst and scuffed custom VLAs (even a mixed size one at one point)). If so, it'd probably be nice to move it into rust-analyzer, either as rust-analyzer/bonsai or a next branch of rust-analyzer.<br>\n2) What index newtype do we want to use (if any)? Do we revisit and clean up str-index as a successor to text_unit, do we just use text_unit as is, do we find a middle ground new release for text_unit, do we vendor a newtype, or do we even just use <code>u32</code> everywhere (or even <code>u32</code> internally but <code>usize</code> for API)?<br>\n    - If we decide to go for str-index as a replacement to text_unit, it should just be a matter of making sure any new API that's been added to text_unit is represented, and a final bikeshed pass. Again, probably a good idea to migrate the repo to the rust-analyzer org if we adopt it.</p>",

It manages to unify the \"cursor\" types in rowan master with the <code>Language</code>-parameterized ones by having a <code>Generic</code> language. Also it currently carries around a <code>Language</code> handle, to enable runtime semantics for interpreters if desired. (Statically known languages would use a ZST, of course.) And hey, that offers an injection point for e.g. span origin information!

The syntax layer could be offered as a layer on top of the green layer, and this would even allow pick-your-abstraction, using no cache, freelist cache, arena cache, etc. Practically? The only bit of \"internals\" of the green tree that the first-principles experiment uses (IIRC) is the moral equivalent of <code>Union2&lt;ArcBorrow&lt;'_, green::Node&gt;, ArcBorrow&lt;'_, green::Token&gt;&gt;</code>. As of current sorbus does not expose a packed version of <code>NodeOrToken</code>; this is exclusively an internal (to the green tree) type.</p>\n<p>Should it be a separate crate, or a separate module? My preference recently has been to treat crates as compilation units; if a clear directional dependency edge (including coherence!) can be drawn, _and publishing on crates-io isn't the primary target_, there should be a split.
