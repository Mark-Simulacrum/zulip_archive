I would like to wrap some code with a method or smart pointer, e.g. if I want to put a box around this <code>LinkedList</code>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/4715/JaGpkIDclkKdull1N2G7BiS4/image.png\">image.png</a> </p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/4715/JaGpkIDclkKdull1N2G7BiS4/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/4715/JaGpkIDclkKdull1N2G7BiS4/image.png\"></a></div><p>It would be really cool if that action menu had an option like <code>Wrap code</code> and then if I put in <code>Box::new</code> or <code>Option</code> it would know to put the code inside the parenthesis. Because in Rust it's very common for me to wrap things with Boxes / Options etc.</p>",
