So far, I came up with following (please note my understanding of the project is still superficial):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Showing it as a new option (find all usages) under the right click menu on trait declaration: <a href=\"/user_uploads/4715/AlYsCVfzvj3pZEv-YDDx_rSY/Screenshot-from-2021-11-07-20-29-13.png\">Screenshot-from-2021-11-07-20-29-13.png</a>. To my understanding, this would require lsp extension so it doesn't seem like a viable option.<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/4715/AlYsCVfzvj3pZEv-YDDx_rSY/Screenshot-from-2021-11-07-20-29-13.png\" title=\"Screenshot-from-2021-11-07-20-29-13.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/4715/AlYsCVfzvj3pZEv-YDDx_rSY/Screenshot-from-2021-11-07-20-29-13.png\"></a></div></li>\n<li>Adding it in annotation - for trait declaration we could add <code>&lt;y&gt; implementations | &lt;x&gt; usages</code> (natually, <code>usages</code> would be clickable and show the list of usages for all trait methods)<br>\nHope my proposals make sense. Looking forward to discussing this with you all :)</li>\n</ol>",
