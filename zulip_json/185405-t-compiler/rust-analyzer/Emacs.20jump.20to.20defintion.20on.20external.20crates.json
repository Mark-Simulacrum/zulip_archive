Now I can jump to definition of serde via M-.</li>\n<li>Not working case - you add new crate via \"cargo add &lt;xyz&gt;\" now use it in your project that is already open. Now I cannot use go-to defintion. But if I do <code>lsp-workspace-restart</code>, I can go to definition of newly added crate (xyz)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>is anyone else facing similar issue? can we make it work without lsp-workspace-restart? NOTE: it works with Go + lsp-mode just fine, without any restart.</p>\n<p>To me it looks like need to add some hook on every time you add crate via cargo!</p>\n<p>Any help is appreciated! thanks :)</p>",
