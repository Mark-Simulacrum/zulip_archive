For example, all the symbols in <code>std::</code>, whether they are in <code>use</code> declarations or just used anywhere in the crate's code.</p>\n<p>I started using R-A as a LSP server (which I'm not very familiar with): I successfully managed to start the process and query it via stdio, and using <code>textDocument/documentSymbol</code> I managet to get the symbols in the crate... But these are not including <code>use</code> declarations. It seems only crate-defined symbols are listed. Is there a better request for LSP towards this end, maybe?</p>\n<p>As an alternative, I saw that R-A has some \"end-user\" ide API, and other crates that maybe I could use. I couldn't find many details on those, and even if I delved a bit into rustc and I can understand a few things, I'm not very familiar with IDE and compiler development and I'm not sure on how to start.</p>\n<p>What could be a good point where to start?<br>\nThank you!</p>",
