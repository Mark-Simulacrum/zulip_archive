Could anyone point me in the right direction for what is the best way to get the public declarations from a crate?</p>\n<p>So far I've been combing through the source, and with trial and error I've  been able to load a database using cli::load_cargo and get all the crates:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>use rust_analyzer::cli::load_cargo;\n\nfn main() -&gt; std::io::Result&lt;()&gt; {\n    let (host, _vfs) = load_cargo(path.as_path(), false, false).unwrap();\n    let db = host.raw_database();\n    let crates = Crate::all(db);\n}\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>And it seems like <a href=\"https://rust-analyzer.github.io/rust-analyzer/hir_def/db/trait.DefDatabase.html#tymethod.crate_def_map\"><code>crate_def_map</code></a> is what I want but I can't figure out how to get a DefDatabase instance</p>",
