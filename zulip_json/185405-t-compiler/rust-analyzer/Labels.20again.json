Should we introduce explicit concept of \"report\" and \"work item\"? Ie, I imagine we can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>add <code>work-item</code> label</li>\n<li>add informal rule that <code>work-item</code>s can only be created by maintainers, and that they need to be separate from reports. Ie, we actively <em>don't</em> try to formulate \"steps to fix\" in the original report and instead file a separate work-item there. </li>\n<li>remove actionable/unactionable label, as I think they are getting at the same thing, just from a wrong direction.</li>\n</ul>",
