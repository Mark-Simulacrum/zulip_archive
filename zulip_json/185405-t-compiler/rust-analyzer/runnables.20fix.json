In fact I know we don't have to add the <code>bin</code> runnableKind if we are in a <code>lib</code> runnableTarget. It seems pretty clear but I have 2 options to implement the fix. First is to filter here <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/rust-analyzer/src/main_loop/handlers.rs#L387\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/rust-analyzer/src/main_loop/handlers.rs#L387\">https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/rust-analyzer/src/main_loop/handlers.rs#L387</a> because we have access to <code>cargo_spec</code> at this location. Other solution is to pass a new argument to this function <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ra_ide/src/lib.rs#L443:L443\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ra_ide/src/lib.rs#L443:L443\">https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/crates/ra_ide/src/lib.rs#L443:L443</a> which would be the TargetKind to know if it's a lib we don't add binary target for main function. But it seems the second solution is better but I think it's a kind of antipattern for salsa to add this kind of argument instead of just keep the Id. And the first solution is a bit annoying because I have to filter at 2 different places: one for handler_runnables and one for handle_codelens. What do you think ?</p>",
