Maybe I missed something in the change log? I can't see anything about new registration types.</p>\n<p>Also, I renamed <code>WorkDoneProgressDone</code> to <code>WorkDoneProgressEnd</code>. I considered creating a new type to maintain the legacy one, but as the library specifically states that the types behind the <code>proposed</code> flag do not guarantee semver compatibility I figured we would be ok with just renaming it. This may be obviously revisited by the project maintainer, but wanted to get your opinion on this anyway</p>",
