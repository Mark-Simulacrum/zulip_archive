I'm guessing it takes an incremental approach and doesn't re-run everything from scratch, but I'm not sure where to look for how this is implemented. Given an edit (say I turn a normal function into an async function by adding the keyword \"async\") how does rust-analyzer updates the AST, analysis results etc.? Which files/modules should I be looking at?</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
