In rustc, when it encounters these lines:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">let</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">h</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">HasAligned</span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">a</span>: <span class=\"nc\">NeedsAlign</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">a</span>: <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">};</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"n\">h</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">calls_autoref</span><span class=\"p\">();</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>It highlights <code>h.a</code> and points out that this method call causes an autoref which is an unsafe ref to a packed repr. Should I handle that in the current PR or as a follow-up? If we do tackle it, how would I even highlight it? Would it make sense to highlight the dot between the field expr and the method to call to signify that it's the call that's causing the issue, or do what rustc does and highlight <code>h.a</code>? But in the latter case, then should I create a new <code>HighlightTag::Expr</code> tag just for this case, or use <code>Operator</code>?</p>",
