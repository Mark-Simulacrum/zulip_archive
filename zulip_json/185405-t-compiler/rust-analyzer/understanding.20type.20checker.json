I'm particularly interested in the idea of sharing code between chalk and rust-analyzer (and eventually rustc). This would probably mean sharing (to start) the representation of types and the logic for lowering a traits + impls into logical rules (and of course the chalk solver itself). In the meantime, the idea would be that rust-analyzer continues to kind of \"explore\" what a new type checker impl might look like (I have thoughts on that, but also want to understand first what you've been up to) and then we try to bridge what rustc has + what rust-analyzer has to create a spec / shared library at some point in the future</p>",

Alternatively, you could add a link to the discussion thread when you make the calendar event, and then post the video to the thread. That would make the video easy to find as well, and doesn't need you to edit the calendar event.</p>",
