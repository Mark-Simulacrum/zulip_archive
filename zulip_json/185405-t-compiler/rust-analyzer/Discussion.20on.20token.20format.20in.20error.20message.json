The initial comment on that was left <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/pull/2911#discussion_r371179967\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/pull/2911#discussion_r371179967\">here</a> by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"133169\">@matklad</span>. I see that we have different opinions on whether we surround tokens with backticks or not. I'd like to set this clearly, because we almost merged the PR but havent come to the conclusion on what error message is better<br>\nthis one:<br>\n<code>Missing trailing `\"` with `#` symbols to terminate the raw byte string literal</code><br>\nor this one without backticks:<br>\n<code>Missing trailing \" with # symbols to terminate the raw byte string literal</code></p>",
