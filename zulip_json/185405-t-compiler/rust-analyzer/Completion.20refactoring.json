Before that, nobody cared what was completed after <code>#[</code> and we did propose to complete a lot there, even though it was not correct.<br>\nWhen I've added this completion, I've had to do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>add another field into the <code>CompletionContext</code>, showing if we're in somewhere right after <code>#[</code></li>\n<li>add a check in the code of every completion that is inappropriately popping up after <code>#[</code> now</li>\n<li>write some code into the attribute completion module, also checking for some more corner cases<br>\nLater, I've been adding the <code>mod</code> completion which followed the same path: new field in the context, new wave of extra checks, finally some new code.<br>\nAnother example is the PR that I've mentioned in the first sentence: it disables completion for some cases completely and manages to perform the checks before running the completions, but still has to add two more fields into the <code>CompletionContext</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>IMO, this all scales pretty bad: <code>CompletionContext</code> now has 48 fields, the majority of them are used either in a single particular completion module (to derive the completion data out of it) or in every module, but just to check that it's appropriate to complete here. Also, some completion modules now have 5 such checks and will get some more, most probably.</p>\n<p>My proposal: add a trait similar to</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>trait Completion {\n    type CompletionData;\n    fn derive_completion_data(ctx: &amp;CompletionContext) -&gt; Option&lt;Self::CompletionData&gt;;\n    fn complete(acc: &amp;mut Completions, ctx: &amp;CompletionContext) -&gt; Option&lt;()&gt;;\n}\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>so that we can move the majority of the <code>CompletionContext</code> fields into <code>CompletionData</code> + remove all the checks there too.<br>\nThis way we can allow no completion-specific data in the context: let it all to be derived during the <code>CompletionData</code> and leave only the shared things like <code>Semantics</code>, <code>RootDatabase</code> and similar.</p>\n<p>This approach does not seem to solve the checks issue entirely, we still have to check for some extra things inside <code>derive_completion_data</code>, but IMO a better api can solve this: since the <code>derive_completion_data</code> method is focused on getting the data, it should be possible.</p>\n<p>Any thoughts or ideas on the topic?

        "content": "<p>Finally got the time to catch up with the discussion :0)</p>\n<p>100% agree that current architecture of completions is a bit of a mess. I also think that the current <em>state</em> of completion might be a mess. Up until relatively recently, completions from rust-analyzer were a sort of fragile miracle, so we tried to keep as many variants as possible. Today, when coverage of the base language is pretty thorough, it makes sense to focus on better filtering and sorting -- not providing erroneous completions, putting good stuff on top. This might require architectural rethinking.</p>\n<p>What I like about current architecture is how all completion variants are independent. I like how we \"compose\" them together with simple function calls here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/886cfd68212bb0b4487d6a822476c350a6eb114f/crates/completion/src/lib.rs#L121-L135\">https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/886cfd68212bb0b4487d6a822476c350a6eb114f/crates/completion/src/lib.rs#L121-L135</a></p>\n<p>Each specific completion kind also doesn't look terrible to me:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/886cfd68212bb0b4487d6a822476c350a6eb114f/crates/completion/src/complete_unqualified_path.rs#L9-L40\">https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/886cfd68212bb0b4487d6a822476c350a6eb114f/crates/completion/src/complete_unqualified_path.rs#L9-L40</a></p>\n<p>(well, attributes and keywords might be exceptions, they do feel messy).</p>\n<p>What I don't like is the initial filling of completion context, there's definitely some room for improvement here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/886cfd68212bb0b4487d6a822476c350a6eb114f/crates/completion/src/completion_context.rs#L350-L499\">https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/886cfd68212bb0b4487d6a822476c350a6eb114f/crates/completion/src/completion_context.rs#L350-L499</a></p>\n<p>Finally, I love how low-tech the current infra is -- it's just a bunch of function calls. I think we should strive to preserve low-techness and avoid traits :-) Assists infra might be a good example here. I am pretty sure that whatever overall code shape we design, it would be implementable without traits :-)</p>\n<p>One plausible issue with Ctx is that it stores one-shot fields, fields used only in a single completion kind. I think we should move this fields to be just local variables in corresponding completion variants. This probably means that <code>file_with_fake_ident</code> should become a field of <code>Ctx</code> such that completions can inspect it. This seems like a piece of work which can be done in isolation. I wonder how much thinner can we make CompletionCtx after that?</p>\n<p>The second issue is that a lot of completion functions have clauses like</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>if in_edge_case1 || in_edge_case2 || in_edge_case3 {\n   return None\n}\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Intuitively, such cutting off of cases that <em>won't</em> work seems fragile. I'd much rather prefer to see</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>if !(in_applicable_case) {\n   return None\n}\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Ie, instead of listing all of the cases that won't work, we list only specific case that will work. It's worth investigating why this approach doesn't work well. I have a hypothesis that this is because our parser does too good error recovery.</p>\n<p>For example, for <code>for _ intelliJRulezzz</code>, we get a tree which looks like this</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>FOR_EXPR\n  PLACEHOLDER_PAT &quot;_&quot;\n  PATH_EXPR\n    IDENT         &quot;intelliJRulezzzz&quot;\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Kotlin's parser gets this instead:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>FOR_EXPR\n  PLACEHOLDER_PAT &quot;_&quot;\n  SYNTAX_ERROR\n    IDENT         &quot;intelliJRulezzzz&quot;\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>We should change the parser to be more like IntelliJ. I don't think there's a general rule here, but I also feel that there maybe many specific rules, fixing all of which would get rid of most of the bad ifs.</p>\n<p>So, action items would be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make it <em>possible</em> to get context when doing completion, and not only in <code>Ctx::fill</code></li>\n<li>Go over each <code>Ctx</code>'s field, and, if it has unique usage, push it down</li>\n<li>Go over each special <code>in_edge_case</code>, find the reason <em>why</em> <code>in_applicable_case</code> won't work there, fix it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are very tactical small steps, but I'd be curious where the full series of such steps leads to.</p>",
