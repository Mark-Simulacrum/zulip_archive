When trying to use cg_clif as frontend for yorick a while ago, I had to instrument the start of each basic block. When the instrumentation function immediately returned without doing anything, the overhead was 15% in the instrumentation function. Which doesn't account for any pessimizations of regalloc. When instrumentation was disabled at runtime using a global flag, the overhead was 30% after writing inline asm to prevent cranelift from spilling registers clobbered in the enabled case. Maybe the overhead could be improved by being  smarter about where to add the instrumentation calls. One instrumentation call at the top of each function may be more doable.</p>",
