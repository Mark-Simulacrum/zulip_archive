It is essentially complete and can build real projects, provided they only use the Rust 2018 edition, since the RA parser currently doesn't support 2015.  It can be used as a development tool to check that RA and rustc produce the same AST, and could theoretically replace the rustc parser (but that would need much better error reporting, ensuring that all invalid code is rejected and more misc work).
