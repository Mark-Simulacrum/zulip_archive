But there's no way to support more than one or just add a standalone file into an open workspace to get some IDE features in it. Here's why: <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/pull/8955#issuecomment-916119471\">https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/pull/8955#issuecomment-916119471</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>move the inlay hints LSP support further: there's an unfortunately stalled PR <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/language-server-protocol/pull/1249\">https://github.com/microsoft/language-server-protocol/pull/1249</a> (most probably more than one) and great confusion for many people on \"why does TypeScript have it in VSCode but Rust does not?\" topic. And a great push towards the feature adoption in our codebase. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>support \"compose Cargo task to run for a workspace\" task: given a certain workspace, add an action that allows to input characters, which are fuzzily matched against all possible <code>cargo</code> command outputs with options, something like this:<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/4715/bbCaC91VSmVUlGHQGkwc157Q/image.png\">image.png</a>ijr.png<br>\nThe point is to create a run configuration out of this to allow the VSCode to rerun the command with a single shortcut which is super useful for cases like \"quickly compose a cargo clippy command to test this module and run it N times\".</p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/4715/bbCaC91VSmVUlGHQGkwc157Q/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/4715/bbCaC91VSmVUlGHQGkwc157Q/image.png\"></a></div></li>\n</ul>",
