I looked at <code>Module::from_file</code> that regularly takes &gt;60ms and it seems that this is coming from <code>db.crate_def_map</code> even though I haven't seen <code>crate_def_map_query</code> itself being called. I'm wondering if this time could be spent in salsa -- trying to figure out if something needs to be recomputed or not? (and then deciding that it doesn't, so in the end <code>create_def_map_query</code> is never called)<br>\nMy experiment: <a href=\"https://github.com/michalt/rust-analyzer/commit/57dee141c34070e8ddf2c870908a01e3ce073eed\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/michalt/rust-analyzer/commit/57dee141c34070e8ddf2c870908a01e3ce073eed\">https://github.com/michalt/rust-analyzer/commit/57dee141c34070e8ddf2c870908a01e3ce073eed</a><br>\nIf my understanding is correct then it seems that this is a bit of a blind spot for how we currently use <code>ra_prof</code> -- we don't know if some unaccounted recomputation is taking long or if the time is spent in salsa. We could potentially add a bunch of more <code>profile</code> around calls to <code>db</code>, but it does feel that this should belong to salsa itself, which has all the information needed to account the time to the right place.</p>\n<p>What do you think? Perhaps I'm misunderstanding something? (also do you know whether salsa has some similar profiling mechanism that we could use?)</p>",
