In my program, I'm doing some syntax transformations for various reasons. I initially reached for <code>SyntaxNode::replace_with</code>, but it asserts that the replacement must have the same <code>kind()</code> as the original node. Is there any particular reasoning behind this? I can't think of a reason why it wouldn't be valid to change to a different <code>SyntaxKind</code> as part of a node replacement. </p>\n<p>I changed over to using <code>splice_children</code> to delete and replace the node in question, and that seems to work fine.</p>",
