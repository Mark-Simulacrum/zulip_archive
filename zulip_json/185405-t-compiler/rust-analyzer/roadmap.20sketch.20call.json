First off, if I may summarize what <strong>I</strong> walked away with, it was basically this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the \"RLS 2.0\" effort will define a kind of \"subset of Rust code\" (likely excluding some of the trickier macros) for which, in general, completions etc should work perfectly (this subset can be minimal but we should have plans to expand it)</li>\n<li>in parallel, we'll be working on extracting and formalizing first name resolution (then type checking) into libaries shared between RLS 2.0 + rustc. These libraries would thus be fully correct.</li>\n</ul>",
