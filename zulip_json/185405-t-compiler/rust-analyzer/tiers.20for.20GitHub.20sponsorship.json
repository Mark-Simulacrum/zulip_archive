Despite this, the Rust Analyzer project has only 13 GitHub sponsors, and is falling well short of a (very reasonable) funding goal. Obviously, getting a few corporate sponsors to step up would very easily reach the goal, but I think the community engagement of having many individual sponsors would also be good for the project. </p>\n<p>Is it worth considering a lower tier, similar to what Homebrew and other OSS projects offer (4–5 USD/month)? It is true that, given the option, most individual sponsors will take the lowest available tier. However, with so few people sponsoring, the net gains of simply getting more people on board might make it worthwhile. The 20+ USD tiers could still be encouraged by offering prioritization of issues or other support.</p>",
