        "content": "<p>Hello- I'm working with complex futures and have been seeing a lot of inference issues around futures; BoxFuture usage is hit pretty hard by it, so anything using async functions on traits is pretty much \"just annotate everything\" if you want to see any useful types at all.</p>\n<p>What I'm seeing is that BoxFuture and similar are typed successfully, but once you <code>await</code> them, the type inference fails to deduce the inner type anymore, and shows <code>&lt;&lt;{unknown} as Deref&gt;::Target as Future&gt;::Output</code> or similar depending on the affected types.</p>\n<p>I've made a repro at <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/Dessix/2d06becd23ff9291d8fab4015d17975b\">https://gist.github.com/Dessix/2d06becd23ff9291d8fab4015d17975b</a> with several scenarios, showing what infers and what doesn't.</p>\n<p>Also, I've seen this occur on <code>Instrument</code> streams and futures from the tokio <code>tracing</code> library; Instrumenting a future makes it go from resolving the type to producing <code>{unknown}</code> in a nested set of typecasts and associated types.</p>\n<p>Additionally, while troubleshooting I've determined that this seems to occur independently of the Chalk environment variables for maximum iterations and tree depth (I set them 10x their defaults and saw no change in the inference result). I haven't been able to find a GitHub issue that fits this scenario.</p>",
