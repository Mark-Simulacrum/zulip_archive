However, I'm not sure which layer this should be implemented on. My initial inclination is that this should be implemented on <code>Parser</code> by adding a new field such as <code>manually_handle_attributes</code>, which if not set will automatically skip and error on attributes (<code>POUND</code>, <code>///</code> and <code>//!</code>) . However, this would complicate many of the methods of  <code>Parser</code>. Writing this out makes me realise this is the way to go though.</p>\n<p>Sorry about the ramble - I don't seem to be able to write well today...</p>\n<p>Also this is my first Zulip topic  - am I doing this right?</p>",

One small tip: you can simplify links to the rust-analyzer repo by typing <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues/846\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues/846\">rust-analyzer#846</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues/509\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues/509\">rust-analyzer#509</a> and have them auto-linked. Also works in the topic name.</p>",

It's not trivial to add them to the validation layer, but adding directly to the parser does not seem trivial either.</p>",
