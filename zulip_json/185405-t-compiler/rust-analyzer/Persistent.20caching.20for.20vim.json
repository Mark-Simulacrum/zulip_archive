I remember seeing a comment quite long ago by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"133169\">@matklad</span>  (can't find it now) saying that RA wants to focus on startup performance and having persistent storage may shift that focus. So persistent store wasn't a priority.<br>\nIs there any update on that now? If not is there any workaround to achieve this?</p>",
