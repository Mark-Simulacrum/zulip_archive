I currently have them attached to a common AST by means of a top-level root module for each \"package\", and child modules as required for each level in the fully qualified path to the referred module</p>\n<p>I'm attempting the same with rowan where I have a root module for each package, then append empty child modules to the needed parent module (if one isn't present already) until I reach the path required, and then append the compiled module as a child. I'm currently trying to use splice_children for this. Could I know if I'm on the right path?</p>",
