I'm currently wondering if there's a good way to get a tree of a (dependency) crates' publicly visible symbols and the names they are available as. Only played with things I got via <code>ra_batch::load_cargo</code> at the moment so I assumed I'm probably just missing knowledge of some parts.</p>",
