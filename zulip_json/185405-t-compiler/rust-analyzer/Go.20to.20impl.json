It does however understand associated types: You can infer <code>Normalize(&lt;SomeType as SomeTrait&gt;::SomeAssocType, ?X)</code> and it will get the value of the associated type from the appropriate impl as the inference variable X. The work I'm doing on chalk is to make a NormalizeFn that will let you ask the same thing but for functions, and it will find you the appropriate function on the impl</p>",
