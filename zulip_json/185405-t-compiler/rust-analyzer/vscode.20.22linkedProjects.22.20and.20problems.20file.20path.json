I have a large project and I am using the \"rust-analyzer.linkedProject\" to point to different \"Cargo.toml\" file that I have in my large repo. </p>\n<p>This sometime work fine, but most of the time (or after a couple of \"Rust-Analyzer: Run\"), it completely stop displaying \"problems\" until I restart vscode.</p>\n<p>It look like vscode is having difficulty to match \"problems\" with the correct file. For example, The \"problem\" will show up in the \"PROBLEMS\" pane with a file path of \"/src/lib.rs\". When I click on it, I simply get a error: \"Unable to open '<a href=\"http://lib.rs\">lib.rs</a>': Unable to read file '/src/lib.rs' ...\".</p>\n<p>I was looking at modifying the \"cargo check\" command to give full path, but this does not seem to be a option. Anyone have a idea how to work around that ?</p>",
