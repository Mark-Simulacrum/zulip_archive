SSR (<a href=\"https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html#structural-search-and-replace\">https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html#structural-search-and-replace</a>) currently only exposes a search and replace function, not just a straight search. Of the examples you gave, the last one (<code>let Single...</code>) is close to the kind of thing SSR could match (although it doesn't yet support matching statements). The first one (searching for methods that take arguments that implement the trait Foo) is the kind of thing SSR might be able to do in the future (but can't now).</p>\n<p>It's not clear if this is something that Strata would support, but something I think would be incredibly useful in an IDE (i.e. in Rust Analyzer) would be a way to say \"I need a Foo\" and have the IDE provide suggestions for how to get a Foo, possibly taking into account what kinds of things I've already got in the function I'm working on. This might involve a little bit of graph searching, since it might be necessary call more than one function.</p>\n<p>This would be great for when you're unfamiliar with a library and don't know that you need to call <code>.into()</code> on a string or something similar in order to get an instance (although obviously documentation helps here too).</p>",
