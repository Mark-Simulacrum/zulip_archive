I wanted to call attention to the VS Code July update, which has shipped the now-stable <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_59#_testing-apis\">Native Test UI</a>. I've update the <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues/3601\">tracking issue (#3601)</a> with all the links.</p>\n<p>I think it would be amazing to provide integrations for this. A full guide how to build for this is available <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/testing\">here</a>. Maybe someone would be interested in prototyping something for this?</p>",
