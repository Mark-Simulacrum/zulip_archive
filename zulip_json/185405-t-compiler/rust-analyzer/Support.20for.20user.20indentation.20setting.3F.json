I know I'm bucking the trend here so I tolerate it, but it would be nice if there were a setting I could use to fix this permanently, or even better if it just automagically figured things out by looking at my vscode tab stop settings, rustfmt settings (which I don't use, but I keep anyway for the sake of external contributors) or the code.</p>",

It doesn't change the relative indentation between two lines in the snippet: if you copy a 4-space indented block of code into a 2-space indentation file, the indents will still be 4 spaces.</p>",
