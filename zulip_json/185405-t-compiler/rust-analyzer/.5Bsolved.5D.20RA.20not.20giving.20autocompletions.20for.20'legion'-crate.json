        "content": "<p>Hi,</p>\n<p>(first time using zulip, so I hope opening a topic was correct to ask a question.)</p>\n<p>I opened up the code of <a href=\"https://github.com/TomGillen/legion\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/TomGillen/legion\">https://github.com/TomGillen/legion</a> in an up-to-date vscode with rust-analyzer from the marketplace (under windows 10). It seems like, e.g., autocompletion is not working everywhere.</p>\n<p>Things seem to work, for example, when I create a new function in <code>src/lib.rs</code>, and look for autocompletions there:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"k\">fn</span> <span class=\"nf\">foobar</span><span class=\"p\">()</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"k\">use</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">prelude</span><span class=\"p\">;</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"kd\">let</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">u</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">prelude</span>::<span class=\"n\">Universe</span>::<span class=\"n\">new</span><span class=\"p\">();</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Now I get autocompletions when I type <code>u.</code>, and types are shown correctly etc. The behavior seems to also be correct when I go to one of the files in one of the workspace members, i.e., \"legion_core\" or \"legion_systems\".</p>\n<p>However, if I go to <code>example/serialization/src/main.rs</code>, and add a function there, like:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"k\">fn</span> <span class=\"nf\">foobar2</span><span class=\"p\">()</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">Universe</span>::\n<span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Then I get no autocompletions (with the curser positioned after the <code>::</code>).</p>\n<p>The directory <code>example</code> seems to be simply a directory, which is also the base of a cargo workspace, with the two members \"hello_world\" and \"serialization\" (\"serialization\" is the one where autocompletions don't seem to work). It has a dependency for legion that looks like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>legion = { path = &quot;../..&quot;, features = [&quot;serialize&quot;] }\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Maybe something is going wrong here?</p>\n<p>Anyway, just wanted to report this. Can help debugging/provide logs etc., but I'm new to rust-analyzer so I have no idea what is needed, therefore just tell me what you would like to see/have me try.</p>\n<p>Thanks! :)</p>",

So if you have a completely separate Cargo workspace for the examples,  I think you'll have to open it in a separate VSCode workspace (which will run a separate RA instance for that Cargo workspace).</p>",
