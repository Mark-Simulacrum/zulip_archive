The replacement I tried was <code>axum::extract::Extension ==&gt;&gt; crate::api::extract::Extension</code>. Using the assist / whatever from vscode didn't do anything after a second or so of appearing to do something, once I had a comment that was correct and applied from that it worked, but only in pattern position. For type position I had to change it to <code>axum::extract::Extension&lt;$a&gt; ==&gt;&gt; crate::api::extract::Extension&lt;$a&gt;</code>. Is this expected?</p>",
