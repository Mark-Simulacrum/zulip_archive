(At small scale, it seems flat iteration takes a much larger hit, but walking keeps the same improvement.)</p>\n<p>My gut tells me the walk benchmark is \"correct\" here and the flat iteration benchmark is just measuring the wrong thing, but I've run out of my knowledge on how to track down this weird behavior. More details and the full criterion report are in the linked issue, I'm happy to answer questions here or on the issue (as well as run further experiments).</p>",
