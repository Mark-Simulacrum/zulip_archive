One way is to converting tokens to a canonical thing (for example Vec to ::std::vec::Vec, but it can be an internal id as well) and memoizing result based on it. Another way is calculating all references when reaching a token, and mark all usages of it as equal. Current finding reference for lsp search all files so I suspect this would become quadratic?</p>",
