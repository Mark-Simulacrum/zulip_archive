I made a sketch for integrating the dyn and impl Trait support and filed it as <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/pull/2026\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/pull/2026\">https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/pull/2026</a>. It compiles, but I've no idea if it's doing anything sane. Maybe someone can take a look or even continue with the implementation?</p>",
