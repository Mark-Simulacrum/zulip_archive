Sorry to ask here, I reckon it might not be the best place, but I think it's better than an issue, as it really isn't one <span aria-label=\"slight smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"slight smile\">:slight_smile:</span> .</p>\n<p>I'm trying to find an example of code that generates a code lens with a <code>applySourceEdit</code> or <code>selectAndApplySourceEdit</code> command, but I can't seem to find a way to get one of those. I browsed through the repo a little and didn't find anything that could help me there, but maybe I wasn't paying enough attention. Can anyone point me to an example or explain a situation in which that code lens would appear?</p>",

I'm adding an extension to LanguageClient-neovim and, considering the date of the commits on those files, I should probably account for users not using the latest version of rust-analyzer. Did this action (<code>applySourceChange</code>) apply for for example extract variable actions? I will probably downgrade to a version of rust-analyzer that has them and try them out, is that a proper action to be looking at for this command?</p>",
