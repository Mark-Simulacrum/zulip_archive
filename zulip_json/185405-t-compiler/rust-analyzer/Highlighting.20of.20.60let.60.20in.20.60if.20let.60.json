On the one hand, having <code>if</code> and <code>let</code> highlighted differently looks strange, while on the other hand the <code>let</code> is conceptually not actually doing any control flow work. Would any rust-analyzer maintainers be able to weigh in here so we can decide whether to implement a fix for the issue?</p>",
