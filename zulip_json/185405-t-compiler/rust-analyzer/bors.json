After this PR was r+-ed it ran tests and complained that the new test in my PR wasn't using $0 to indicate the cursor position. This makes sense - my PR pre-dated that change. However, I'm not sure what to do about it - there are no merge commits on the PR itself. I've tried pushing a change to update just the cursor indicator in the newly added test, but this results in the tests failing and complaining that the _old_ cursor style isn't present.</p>\n<p>What's the current workflow here?</p>",
