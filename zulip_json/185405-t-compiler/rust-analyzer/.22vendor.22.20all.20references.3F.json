But I'm looking for something to help me with an idea, which is to inline the transitive closure of all external functions and types' source code into a local directory, similar to what <code>cargo vendor</code> does, but including only the \"minimal\" source code to support the usages in the client code you're writing. I see notes in here talking about how, eg, full-project symbol resolution is still not really there, but it still seems like RA would have the functionality within it to produce what I'm looking for.</p>",
