Now, i am trying to get RA to autoimport some things, and its doing it, great. But here comes the ??? part, it is importing it from a package called <code>ammonia</code>, now, ammonia has nothing to do with llvm, it is html sanitization. The weird thing is RA seems to think that it is llvm-sys, it is an impostor llvm-sys. Hovering over it says it is bindings to llvm, and going to definition goes to llvm-sys. So i am guessing this is RA mixing up things. Reloading and cargo cleaning does not fix it either.</p>",
