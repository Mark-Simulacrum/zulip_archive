I have a question about the instructions provided. What exactly does \"assign codes to our diagnostics to match rustc\" mean? I found that <code>Assist</code> has <code>AssistId</code> - so would it be a case of having some sort of Map somewhere that maps AssistIds to rustc diagnostic codes?  Or am I looking at the wrong place</p>",

However, in the implementations of ra <code>Diagnostic</code>s, the codes are already defined as text names like <code>no-such-field</code> instead of <code>E0123</code> etc. Would it be okay to change the appripriate ones to match rustc?
