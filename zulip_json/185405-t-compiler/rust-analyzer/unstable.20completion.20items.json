I was looking at this issue <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues/2003\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues/2003\">https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues/2003</a> and was trying to figure out what it would take to fix it. I managed to keep the unstable macros out of the completion items list by checking whether they include the unstable attribute, but I have a couple of doubts.</p>\n<p>- Should this be fixed only for macros? Or all kinds of completion items?<br>\n- I have mixed feelings about modifying <code>Completions::add_macro</code> to check if the node has an <code>unstable</code> attribute, mainly because the name of the function, <code>add_macro</code> sounds like it should definitely add a macro  completion item to the list. But doing that check before the call to <code>add_macro</code> means having duplicated code. Am I being to pedantic and should just add that check there?</p>",
