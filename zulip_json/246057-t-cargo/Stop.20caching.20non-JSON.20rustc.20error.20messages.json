However, when switching to other tools or executing <code>cargo build</code>, cached output from those tools is still shown. That is bad since we are not using those tools to build.</p>\n<p>I don't think cargo should add wrapper into fingerprint and invalidate when switching. My proposal is not to cache any non-JSON error messages from rustc or wrapper. But I am afraid there are tools depending on this implicit behavior and get broken.</p>\n<p>Original issue here: <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/9553\">https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/9553</a></p>",
