Once you've found a root config you cause parse the original Cargo.toml and then look at members like you normally would. If this isn't what was wonted can you maybe describe what you are looking for a bit more?</p>",

That original comment still summarizes what I'm thinking, which is that there's some intermediate form which is elaborated to the final form with a <code>WorkspaceConfig</code>. That should be an explicit step somewhere and the parsing code isn't intertwined with searching for workspaces and such on the filesystem</p>",

        "content": "<p>So currently, read manifest returns an IntermediateManifest which has the pkg id, TomlManifest, and the workspace config. When looking for the config it just checks if the works space config is a root. Once it finds a root it parses it into a manifest and a package using load (which eventually will take a root config). Once you find the root it parses the original manifest. then moves on to finding members which when one is found it is parsed into a package and put in the correct location. Load calls for the Intermediate and then uses to_real_manifest to make a real manifest for a package. So the step is there it's just hasn't changed much. This way searching for the Toml is done in read_manifest and the parsing is done by to_real_manifest. If you want it delayed further or want more fields to be elaborated I can do that.</p>",
