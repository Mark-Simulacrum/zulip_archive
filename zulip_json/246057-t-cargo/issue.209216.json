I reported a panic in cargo with <code>resolver = \"2\"</code> 10 days ago, and from the folks I talked too, it seemed like a pretty critical issue that should be fixed as <code>resolver = \"2\"</code> is in beta. The bug report was originally with <code>resolver = \"1\"</code> and the panic is a little obscure/buried in the thread, so I wanted to make sure y'all didn't miss it! Apologies if you're aware already, just isn't a lot of activity on the thread. <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/9216\">https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/9216</a></p>",
