This is what I expected, and is consistent with what's described here: <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#hierarchical-structure\">https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#hierarchical-structure</a>, but I think it could be more clear about the fact that it's \"local configuration\" (for some definition of local).</p>\n<p>Specifically, you can't use it to, for example, set some rustflags that your crate requires, and have this actually work for people depending on your crate.</p>\n<p>So, I'd like to improve the docs here to make it clear what the configuration can't be/isn't intended to be used for. That said, not only I am pretty sure whatever I would come up with as a first cut of a doc update wouldn't cut it, but I'm not even sure that my understanding is correct. </p>\n<p>Specifically, are these statements all true?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>configuration from <a href=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a> (or other registry) dependencies is never used.</li>\n<li>configuration from git (or other vcs) dependencies is never used.</li>\n<li>configuration from a path dep will only be used if the path dep is a direct parent, but this configuration would be used even if that path dep did not exist.</li>\n<li>more generally: the list of configuration files that are combined to produce the result configuration doesn't consider the dependency graph of whatever is being compiled.</li>\n</ol>",
