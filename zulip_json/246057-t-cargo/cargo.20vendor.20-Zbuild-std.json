The current recommended way to do this is <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/unstable.html#build-std\">with <code>cargo -Zbuild-std</code></a>. However, Firefox's CI is a vendored environment, so the dependencies of std need to be pre-resolved and vendored for this to work. I could potentially just work out by hand what the missing vendors are, but I'd like an <em>easily maintainable</em> solution. One that doesn't make compiler version bumps a huge nightmare. I briefly considered <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/78533\">pre-built instrumented binaries</a> but this requires me to reinvent cargo's logic for not using the instrumented std for build scripts and plugins, and seemed like a big project to simulacrum.</p>\n<p>I am now persuing the avenue of thought: maybe <code>cargo vendor -Zbuild-std</code> should Just Work. Clearly cargo has the ability to pull up the Cargo.toml for std and compute its build graph. If we could teach <code>cargo vendor</code> to incorporate that information, my problem would be perfectly solved!!!(?) If this sounds reasonable, I'm willing to help / do all the work for the implementation (though would need a bit of guidance on what to change).</p>",

Perhaps this pushes more to the \"CI will run a build-std vendor\" solution.
