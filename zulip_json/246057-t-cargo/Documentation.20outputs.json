        "content": "<p>This is kind of a complicated question but I'll give it my best shot. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"265377\">@Will Crichton</span> is writing a tool to show where a function is used, in particular across crates and including <code>examples</code>: <a href=\"https://github.com/willcrichton/example-analyzer\">https://github.com/willcrichton/example-analyzer</a>. It's based on a fork of rustdoc and I'm hoping to upstream it into rustdoc directly at some point. The issue is that it introduces a reverse dependency between documentation builds of the example and documentation builds of the main crate. It looks something like this (simplified):</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Bash\"><pre><span></span><code>$ rustc --profile check src/lib.rs\n$ example-analyzer examples/a/main.rs --extern <span class=\"nv\">my_crate</span><span class=\"o\">=</span>/path/to/libmy_crate.rlib --output call-locations.json\n$ rustdoc src/lib.rs --call-locations /path/to/call-locations.json\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>(JSON is temporary, if <code>example-analyzer</code> and <code>rustdoc</code> use the same toolchain it can serialize DefIds in an .rlib directly, although I need to work out how that interacts with rustc_metadata.)</p>\n<p>Is this something that makes sense in cargo's build model? I don't see any cyclic dependencies here, but I'm sure this is definitely not the order things happen in currently. If it's not, would you be interesting in adding it, assuming this gets upstreamed to rustdoc?</p>",

In cargo-callgraph (not yet released publicly, I think my v0.1 will be available next week), I should be able to do it. At the same time, I’m not sure it’s needed if the goal is to find all examples where a given function is used. I think that both of our project have a lot in common, and exchanging a bit is probably going to be very fruitful for both!</p>",
