At the moment, it looks like this doesn't include the libcore / libcompiler_builtins objects, so I get some very sad link errors when I consume the staticlib (which I've verified work fine if I manually include the built rlibs for core/compiler_builtins). IIUC without build-std, the required std / core / etc objects get bundled in so that the staticlib can just be linked to C code, etc.</p>\n<p>Is this a bug? (Or am I missing something?)</p>",
