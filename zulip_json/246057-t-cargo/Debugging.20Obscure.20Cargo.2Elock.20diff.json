We've spent quite a bit of time debugging this issue, and the only concrete link we've found is that different dependencies seem to be disappearing/appearing as a result of the default features for some dependencies changing for some reason between these machines.</p>\n<p>We've tested multiple (both older and newer) versions of cargo, new and older versions of the package, and the issue happens regardless. These packages don't use <code>autocfg</code> or anything as far as we can tell that would cause these default features to change without source changes. One of these cases for example is <code>hashbrown</code> having <code>ahash</code> (a default optional dependency) being dropped.</p>\n<p>We're currently trying to build a reproducible case to share, but we're having difficulty isolating anything that would point to why this would be happening. Would you's have any insight on how to best debug this kind of issue? I've poured over the <code>CARGO_LOG=trace</code> of the builds and couldn't find anything useful in that.</p>",
