I think I've actually mostly succeeded for this, but I don't have any dependency info for the gcno/gcda files, so I end up having to clean and rebuild/run everything to ensure they're up to date each time.</p>\n<p>This kind of sucks, and is because the .gcno and .gcda files are not listed in the dep info files (or whatever the <code>target/*/*.d</code> files  are called) when -Z profile is produced the way .rlib and such are. It would be nice if entries for these were present...</p>\n<p>... That said, I... am only like 50% sure this request makes any sense / is possible, I'm still sort of understanding of the problem space and how the gcno/gcda files work and such, which is why I'm asking here as opposed to starting by filing a <code>cargo</code> issue. (That said, if this is just an oversight I'd be willing to implement the fix for it).</p>\n<p>Sorry for the possibly vague/confusing question, and thanks for any insight.</p>",
