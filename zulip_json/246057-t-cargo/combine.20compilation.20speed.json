I was noticing that <code>combine</code> was taking about 20s to run <code>cargo check</code> on cargo itself, which seemed really fishy (that's slower than every other crate by far). It seems like it is due to some CPU throttling that happens on my laptop when there are too many things building at once.  In isolation, it only takes about 5s to check (which is still pretty slow, but reasonable).  I tried a few different <code>-j</code> values, which made <code>combine</code> build much faster, but didn't help the overall finish time.</p>",
