I know that you can override CARGO_HOME but that seems to break the resolution of the config file, which is not ideal. I got as far as modifying <code>src/cargo/util/config/mod.rs</code> before realizing that the current target directory is not available... is there any way to access it consistently from the config or would this require a bunch of refactoring?</p>",

Usually if you want to propose a feature, it would be good to discuss it on the issue tracker or on internals. There is a pretty big queue of things, so I can't promise that we would be able to respond to it, but if you write a proposal I can try to bring it up during a team meeting.</p>",
