I'm stuck at one point, though. I'm using <code>--emit=link</code> flag to tell <code>rustc</code> what to name the binary, however, it takes a full path. To do this, I'm using the <code>cx.files().out_dir(unit)</code> to get the directory where we are saving our created binaries.</p>\n<p>However, this path leads to <code>/target/debug/deps</code> instead of <code>target/debug</code>. The test which I have written fails because the binary gets created in the wrong directory. Am I missing something here?</p>\n<p>Shouldn't the <code>out_dir</code> be <code>target/debug</code>?</p>",
