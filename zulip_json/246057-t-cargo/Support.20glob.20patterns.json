I have already done a minimal proof-of-concept (also commented in that issue) and want to know if this feature is acceptable. In addition, I want to expand this feature a bit further. Could it be possible and worthy to support <code>CompileFilter</code> level glob patterns? That will make things like <code>cargo test --test \"some-test-*\"</code> become possible. I am happy to discuss and help.</p>",

There's a little more discussion about using globs for target filters in <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6454\">https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6454</a>. Some people want a way to run \"integration tests but not unit tests\" (though I'm not sure why), and something like <code>--tests=*</code> would address that. </p>\n<p>But I'm a little concerned about the problems with shell quoting using <code>*</code>.  Offhand I don't have any alternate suggestions, though.  Maybe just mentioning that in the documentation would be enough?</p>",
