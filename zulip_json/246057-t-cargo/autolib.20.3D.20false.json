        "content": "<p>Currently in Cargo.toml you can set <code>autobins = false</code> to avoid cargo picking up targets automatically for <code>src/main.rs</code> (and all the other places where binary targets would normally live). There also exists options for <code>autoexamples</code>, <code>autotests</code>, and <code>autobenches</code>. <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/cargo-targets.html#target-auto-discovery\">documentation</a></p>\n<p>However, there's no <code>autolib</code> option for <code>src/lib.rs</code>. Would such an option be a reasonable addition?</p>\n<p>My usecase: I have a crate which is entirely just an integration test of other software. Since the whole crate is just a test, it's not really clear what the crate root should be named, and because of historical accident it got named <code>src/lib.rs</code>. It doesn't normally actually get built by cargo at all (it uses another build system which drives rustc itself), but I'd like to _generate_ a <code>Cargo.toml</code> for this crate so that I can use the <code>cargo</code> ecosystem of tooling with it. So I've generated a <code>Cargo.toml</code> that looks something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>[package]\nname = &quot;autolib&quot;\nversion = &quot;0.1.0&quot;\nedition = &quot;2021&quot;\n\n[[test]]\nname = &quot;autolib&quot;\npath = &quot;src/lib.rs&quot;\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Which sort of works, but behaves weirdly:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>$ cargo test --test autolib -v\nwarning: file found to be present in multiple build targets: /home/cdruid/autolib/src/lib.rs\n   Compiling autolib v0.1.0 (/home/cdruid/autolib)\n     Running `rustc --crate-name autolib --edition=2021 src/lib.rs --error-format=json --json=diagnostic-rendered-ansi --crate-type lib --emit=dep-info,metadata,link -C embed-bitcode=no -C debuginfo=2 -C metadata=989134b57a80d57f -C extra-filename=-989134b57a80d57f --out-dir /home/cdruid/autolib/target/debug/deps -C incremental=/home/cdruid/autolib/target/debug/incremental -L dependency=/home/cdruid/autolib/target/debug/deps`\n     Running `rustc --crate-name autolib --edition=2021 src/lib.rs --error-format=json --json=diagnostic-rendered-ansi --emit=dep-info,link -C embed-bitcode=no -C debuginfo=2 --test -C metadata=b69d9bd01c641b07 -C extra-filename=-b69d9bd01c641b07 --out-dir /home/cdruid/autolib/target/debug/deps -C incremental=/home/cdruid/autolib/target/debug/incremental -L dependency=/home/cdruid/autolib/target/debug/deps --extern autolib=/home/cdruid/autolib/target/debug/deps/libautolib-989134b57a80d57f.rlib`\n    Finished test [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.68s\n     Running `/home/cdruid/autolib/target/debug/deps/autolib-b69d9bd01c641b07`\n\nrunning 1 test\ntest t ... ok\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>That is, it first builds <code>lib.rs</code> as a lib, and then builds it as a test, which depends on the lib it just built. Which isn't what we want.</p>\n<p>One thing that almost works is adding:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>[lib]\ncrate-type = []\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Then it doesn't get build as a dependency of the test. But that breaks <code>cargo build --all-targets</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>$ cargo build --all-targets\nwarning: file found to be present in multiple build targets: /home/cdruid/autolib/src/lib.rs\nerror: cannot compile `autolib v0.1.0 (/home/cdruid/autolib)` as the target `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` does not support any of the output crate types\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I think an <code>autolib</code> toggle in the style of the other ones would make sense, and would solve this conundrum nicely. I'd probably be interested in implementing this if it were welcome and I could get some implementation pointers. I'd also be happy to file an issue on github if it's something that makes sense to others.</p>",
