Therefore, I have among others, a package as member that contains on it's <code>Cargo.toml</code> the following:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"TOML\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">[package]</span>\n<span class=\"n\">name</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">\"XXX\"</span>\n<span class=\"n\">version</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">\"0.1.0\"</span>\n<span class=\"n\">authors</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span>\n  <span class=\"s\">\"CPerezz &lt;mail&gt;\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"p\">]</span>\n<span class=\"n\">edition</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">\"2018\"</span>\n<span class=\"n\">autobins</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kc\">false</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">[lib]</span>\n<span class=\"n\">name</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">\"XXX\"</span>\n<span class=\"n\">path</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">\"lib/lib.rs\"</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">[[bin]]</span>\n<span class=\"n\">name</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">\"XXX\"</span>\n<span class=\"n\">path</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">\"bin/main.rs\"</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The package has the same name as the lib and the bin. At the same time, I have XXX as a member on the workspace. <br>\nAnd finally the dir structure looks like:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>|\n|-- Cargo.toml (workspace one which XXX included)\n|-- XXX/\n     |-- Cargo.toml (contains the manifest posted above)\n     |-- src/\n           |-- lib/lib.rs\n           |-- bin/bin.rs\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I assume is not a naming problem since this worked when I didn't have the workspace. But as soon as I added it, it started failing on te build saying:<br>\n<code> couldn't read XXX/lib/lib.rs: No such file or directory (os error 2)</code> which I found really weird. </p>\n<p>Are there any known limitations for workspaces in these kind of situations?? Thanks</p>",

        "content": "<p>For <code>lib.rs</code> and <code>main.rs</code> you have to specify the paths relative to the Cargo.toml directory. So adding <code>src/</code> in front of the paths in the <code>Cargo.toml</code> should fix this.</p>",
