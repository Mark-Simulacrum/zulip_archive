This encoded variable is equivalent to RUSTFLAGS.  If you don't specify <code>--target</code>, RUSTFLAGS applies to both, if you do specify <code>--target</code>, then it only applies to target. There is no option to specify host-only flags, yet (<a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/4423\">https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/4423</a>).  The idea is that once <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/4423\">#4423</a> is fixed, then there could be a <code>CARGO_ENCODED_HOST_RUSTFLAGS</code> to match.   I think Jon's concern was that the wording here could be confusing with the historical use of RUSTFLAGS, and since there isn't much progress on supporting host-specific RUSTFLAGS, it's not really clear exactly what that would look like.</p>",
