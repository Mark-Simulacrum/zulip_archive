        "content": "<p>As of now <code>features</code> are a simple object of the form <code>{str: [str]}</code> and optional dependencies implicitly create a new feature with the same name.</p>\n<p>This has some drawbacks that I'd like to discuss:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is no way to describe a feature. Right now crates often don't document their features at all and if they do it's in an unstructured way as part of the README file. It would be nice if there was a way to add documentation to features (and optional dependencies).</li>\n<li>Optional dependencies always become features even if they are only dependencies of other features.</li>\n<li>Features and optional dependencies share the same namespace. Thus in order to write a feature <code>foo</code> that enables the optional dependency<code>foo</code> the dependency needs an alias. e.g. <code>foo-crate = { package = \"foo\", ...}</code> and the resulting feature list becomes even more convoluted. (e.g. <a href=\"https://docs.rs/crate/deadpool/0.7.0/features\">https://docs.rs/crate/deadpool/0.7.0/features</a>, <code>config</code> enables both the <code>config-crate</code> and <code>serde</code> dependency.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I wonder if there are any plans to improve this situation. I would love to see something like that in a future version of <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"TOML\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">[features.config]</span>\n<span class=\"n\">default</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kc\">true</span>\n<span class=\"n\">description</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Enable support for config crate\"</span>\n<span class=\"n\">dependencies</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">[\"config-crate\", \"serde/derive\"]</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Going one step further I wonder if it would make sense to put futures and crates into their own namespace and differentiating between crate and feature dependencies thus making it possible to have both a <code>config</code> feature and a <code>config</code> dependency at the same time. Also it would make a lot of sense if optional dependencies would not implicitly result in features but need to be made public explicitly:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"TOML\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">[features.serde]</span>\n<span class=\"n\">dependencies</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">[\"serde/derive\"]</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">[features.config]</span>\n<span class=\"n\">enable_features</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">[\"serde\"]</span>\n<span class=\"n\">dependencies</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">[\"config\"]</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This is something that's been bugging me for quite some time now and I started hacking <a href=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a> trying to add a proper features tab to it. I had to realize that this needs to a change of the underlying <code>Cargo.toml</code> and <code>cargo</code> to be more useful than what <code>docs.rs</code> currently provides.</p>\n<p>This is by no means an RFC. I'd like to hear from you what you think of this and if it's worth putting this into a proper RFC.</p>",
