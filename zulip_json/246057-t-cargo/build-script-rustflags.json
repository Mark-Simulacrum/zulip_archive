I recently came across a <a href=\"https://github.com/dtolnay/anyhow/issues/156\">bug in anyhow</a> whose root cause is that it does  \"test compile\" to see whether it can make use of some nightly features, but that test compile does not take into account Cargo configuration like <code>[build] rustflags = </code>. Looking through the <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html#environment-variables-cargo-sets-for-build-scripts\">environment variables Cargo sets for build scripts</a> it doesn't appear that things like the rustc wrapper or the final rustflags is actually passed to the build script — is that intentional?</p>",
