Turns out that one of the binaries in that crate depends on a feature for one of its dependencies that it's apparently getting because it gets enabled in another crate. I then figured I'd try to enable resolver = \"2\" in the workspace because I understood it to solve this kind of issue (if not, perhaps, this exact issue). So what's the expected resolution behavior for binaries across crates in a workspace? Are they still unified somehow?</p>",
