For a new project, I'm able to generate the lockfile and create a local registry before going offline. To point to the local registry I add the <code>[source.crates-io]</code> and <code>[source.local-registry]</code> options into the <code>.../project/.cargo/config.toml</code>.</p>\n<p>The pain point starts here. I'm back online and want to update a dependency. To do that and update my local registry, I need to edit/remove the project local <code>.cargo/config.toml</code> so I can generate a new lockfile using the proper <code>crates.io</code> then revert the <code>.cargo/config.toml</code>. </p>\n<p>Would a new <code>--ignore-local-config</code> flag be appropriate or is there a better way around this that I'm missing?</p>",
