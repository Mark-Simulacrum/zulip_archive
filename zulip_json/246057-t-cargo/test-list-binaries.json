Which made me wonder â€” it'd be nice to have something like <code>cargo test --list-binaries</code> that just lists all the test binaries that _would_ have been running given the remaining arguments to <code>test</code> (<code>--lib</code>, <code>--tests</code>, etc.). Would something like that be a welcome addition, or are there compelling reasons to not expose the paths to the binaries?</p>",

Maybe that's as intended, it just feels like this is a straightforward enough task that it could be supported directly</p>",
