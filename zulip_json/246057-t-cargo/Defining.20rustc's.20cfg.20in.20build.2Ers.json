However you're using system library and you use some functions from newer versions of it, which couldn't be available on the target platform. So the thing you usually do in such cases is that you try to compile some code with that library and set a 'feature'(you may pass random cfg though, feature isn't really required) if it compiles fine, and then you properly handle missing things in your code.</p>\n<p>Also, I don't want to completely redefine cfg, that cargo will be passing to rustc, just append to it.</p>\n<p>If there's a known way to do that?</p>",
