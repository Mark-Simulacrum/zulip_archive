That is, I'd like to wait for the relevant feature to land in beta (still under an unstable flag), import the beta, and then set some magic flag that allows the internal build system to use _just_ this particular unstable feature. I'm imagining the equivalent of <code>env CARGO_BOOTSTRAP=\"patch-in-config\"</code>. I know it's a super dirty hack, but I think bringing in an actual nightly as the official internal toolchain would be a tough sell. In part because it may have yet-to-be-discovered bugs, and in part because it blanket-enables the use of nightly features, which isn't ideal. Bringing in a beta on the other hand I think I could argue for without too much trouble.</p>\n<p>If some workaround like this is a non-starter, then I'll only be able to test <code>patch-in-config</code> on a much smaller scale, specifically on a small subset of the internal packages I control, as opposed to all of them.</p>\n<p>cc <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116015\">@Alex Crichton</span></p>",
