This wound up updating a submodule as well (not tragic, just coalesced a couple imports, but technically not really related to my change). When I ran <code>cargo fmt</code>, though, it reformatted dozens of files (over 100) from all over the repository, completely unrelated to my changes, and I did not include them.</p>\n<p>That was using a recent nightly toolchain, though. Using stable resulted in a saner set of things formatted. However, it was accompanied by a bunch of warnings, eg, <code>Warning: can't set `wrap_comments = true`, unstable features are only available in nightly channel.</code>.</p>\n<p>So my question is, which version of <code>rustfmt</code> should we be using to format our code for submission?</p>",
