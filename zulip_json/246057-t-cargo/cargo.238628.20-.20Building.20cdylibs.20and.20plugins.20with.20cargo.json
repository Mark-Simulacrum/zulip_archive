Reading over the issue a new <code>[[clib]]</code> or similar section sounds like a great idea to me, and I would suspect that this would be best followed up with an RFC describing the proposal in more detail. The implementation here is likely not the hardest thing in the world (mostly just copying what <code>[[bin]]</code> does in Cargo since there doesn't seem to be anything radically different about the proposed <code>[[clib]]</code></p>",
