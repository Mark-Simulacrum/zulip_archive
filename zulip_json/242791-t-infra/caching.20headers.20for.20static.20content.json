This is particularly noticeable for the fonts, since loading the fonts late causes shifts on the page.</p>\n<p>I filed <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/simpleinfra/issues/62\">https://github.com/rust-lang/simpleinfra/issues/62</a> suggesting to add caching headers, but I haven't heard back. Did I file it in the right place? Is there anything I can do to help get it done?</p>",
