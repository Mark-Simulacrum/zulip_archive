It's <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang-ci/rust/runs/3821338528\">just one builder</a>, <code>s390x-linux</code>, that's timing out; all the others finish successfully. It doesn't seem to time out on other PRs. I'm quite baffled as to why this is happening since all my PR does is refactor rustdoc. The builder seems to be timing out while building stage2 rustdoc; it starts building the <code>rustdoc</code> crate at <code>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 01:27:16 GMT</code> and times out at <code>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 03:43:07 GMT</code>.</p>\n<p>I would greatly appreciate any help in figuring out why it keeps timing out, so I can fix it and get this PR merged. Thanks!</p>",
