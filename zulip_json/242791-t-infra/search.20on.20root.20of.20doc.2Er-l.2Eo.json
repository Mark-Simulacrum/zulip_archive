It's jarring to get taken off-domain.</p>\n<p>The big reason is: I'd like for users of the Rust documentation to get the nice browser integration where you type, e.g. \"Rust \" and it offers \"search Rust Documentation\" as an option. Based on research, it seems this was possible to get based on OpenSearch, but now the only way to get it is via browser heuristics, but those are fairly well documented. For Chrome, to get this experience, there needs to be a search box on the root page of a hostname (and the user needs to interact with it).</p>\n<p>Does this sound good / feasible?</p>",
