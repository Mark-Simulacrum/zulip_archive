Embedded WG is currently the maintainer of <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross\">cross</a>, but we're lacking maintainer time to give it the attention it deserves. See <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross/issues/574\">rust-embedded/cross#574</a> Do you have any suggestions or ideas on what we could do?</p>\n<p>Reason for asking here is cross being used in some rust-lang/ crates CI, for example hashbrown, futures-rs and regex</p>\n<p>We've discussed some alternatives on what we could do, but we want more input.</p>",
