In doing so this would require us to update the bors configuration and the bors configuration with github actions seems a bit wonky (weird builders that are conditionally skipped and such). I was wondering if perhaps the new bors-rs made it a bit more convenient to configure a repo? Or additionally, if infra is interested for a guinea pig in the Rust project for bors-rs the cargo team would be happy to <del>sacrifice ourselves</del> volunteer.</p>",
