This is pretty great, but what i've found is that it ends up happening pretty often and ends up subscribing me to more threads than I want to be on.</p>\n<p>There are some cases where you actually do have to ping the entire team (when you want approval for something, etc), but sometimes when you \"just want wider input\" the better thing to do is to start a Zulip thread. It's also a better platform for such discussions in general.</p>\n<p>I wonder if there's benefit in e.g. having something like <code>@triagebot zulip-thread &lt;topic name&gt;</code> so that it's super easy to create zulip threads that link back to the issue (and ideally duplicate the text of your comment after the <code>@triagebot</code> command), and get a comment on the issue linking to the zulip thread. I feel like this would be super useful but I'm not sure which bot to plug it into.</p>\n<p>cc <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"232545\">@Joshua Nelson</span></p>",
