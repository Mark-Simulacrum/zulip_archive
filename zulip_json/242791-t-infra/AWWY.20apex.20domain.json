        "content": "<p>Hello!  2 years ago I opened a ticket to get the apex domain working with AreWeWebYet.  Recently, it has moved to the <code>rust-lang</code> org, and the domain's registrar has changed from Ghandi to AWS.  I'm assuming that registrar switch means the domain is now managed by the rust team too. When the default domain is set to the <code>www</code> subdomain with GitHub Pages, the apex domain will not redirect properly (and vice-versa).  The best solution would be adding a CNAME/ALIAS record (idk what AWS calls it) to the apex domain pointing towards the <code>www</code> subdomain.
