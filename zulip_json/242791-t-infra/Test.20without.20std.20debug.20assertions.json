In <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78122\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78122</a>, I want to run a test that needs to look at the result at look something compiled against an std without debug assertions. But it seems like pretty much every test builder has those enabled. Should there be a way to compile std without debug assertions in addition to what's currently built? Or std's debug assertions be disabled on some of the runners, just to test that case too?</p>",
