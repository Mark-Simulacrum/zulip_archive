In the run for <code>pr-73345-3</code>, running <code>cargo check</code> appears to have checked the <em>tests</em> as well (note all of the extra dependencies that are getting built for the same crate version). The line is the error message is behind a <code>#[cfg(test)]</code>.</p>\n<p>In the run for <code>pr-73345-5</code>, it looks like we didn't check the tests, despite running the same <code>cargo</code> command in the same docker image. This is the behavior I would expect, since I'm pretty sure that <code>cargo check</code> doesn't check tests without the <code>--tests</code> flag. However, I hve no idea why this was different between runs</p>",
