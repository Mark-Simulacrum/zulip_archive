This can help us spot unexpected lint output changes (FPs/FNs) that appear in code in the ecosystem. </p>\n<p>Right now I have a prototype at <a href=\"https://github.com/matthiaskrgr/clippy-lintcheck\">https://github.com/matthiaskrgr/clippy-lintcheck</a> which runs every 12 hours, each run takes around 35-45 minutes of ci time (it only needs a single runner though).<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/matthiaskrgr/clippy-lintcheck/runs/2293318284?check_suite_focus=true\">https://github.com/matthiaskrgr/clippy-lintcheck/runs/2293318284?check_suite_focus=true</a></p>\n<p>At the last clippy meeting we wondered if we could move the repo to the rust-lang org. :)</p>",
