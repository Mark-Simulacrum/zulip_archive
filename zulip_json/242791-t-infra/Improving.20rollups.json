I'd like to continue those conversations here and start experimenting with ways to actually improve the rollup process.</p>\n<p>Overall, the goal of rolling up is to get changes into master faster and to make sure the queue does not get backed up. This means we want to maximize the number of PRs in a rollup and simultaneously minimize the number of changes that cause any issues (including failing builds, introducing performance regressions, etc.). Each rollup has an associated risk associated with it. I'd like to start exposing the estimated risk to users of the homu queue, track the success rate of \"risky\" rollups, and see if we can eventually lower the percentage of rollups that fail. </p>\n<p>My first change was to add a \"riskiness\" label to the rollup when creating it. This at least starts exposing to users of the queue how relatively risky their rollup is predicted to be: <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/homu/pull/138\">https://github.com/rust-lang/homu/pull/138</a></p>",

Largely because - most reviewers/other lurkers often use rollup=always sparingly and mostly for minor prs. </p>\n<p>Though getting stats for rollup=maybe and rollup=iffy would be nice and we can check probably how many of those should have been rollup=never to start with</p>",

(I guess having larger rollups reduced the chances of it occurring) </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>overall i'd think a PR remains for 1-2 days in normal cases, and 3-4 days or a week in worse cases but these are just speculations</p>",
