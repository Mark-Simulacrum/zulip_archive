        "content": "<p>Dear infra team,<br>\nMiri used to have a daily cronjob that checks if everything still works when building and testing Miri against rustc master. (That test suite is slightly more expansive than what is tested as part of rustc CI.) With the move to GHA, that cronjob still exists but there are no email notifications when the job fails. Looks like GHA <a href=\"https://github.community/t/no-email-notification-on-schedule-cron-job-failure/119638\">does not support notifications for cronjobs</a> except by manually talking to an SMTP server as part of the job (a pretty serious regression compared to other services if you ask me). The same issue also applies to <a href=\"https://github.com/RalfJung/miri-test-libstd\">miri-test-libstd</a>, which I left on Travis for that reason, but I think I ran out of free minutes now (though I am not sure, the dashboard where it's supposed to tell me is buggy and all the numbers are missing).</p>\n<p>Do you know of any way we could have CI cronjobs with email notifications?</p>",
