It is trying to fetch <code>GITHUB_BASE_REF</code> which is the destination branch for the PR (master). The original clone is a shallow clone (depth 2) which means that if your PR is too far away from the current master, the call to <code>git fetch GITHUB_BASE_REF</code> ends up trying to fetch the entire repository. I'm not sure why it gets confused and breaks on the submodules, perhaps some weird git issue or interaction with GitHub and shallow clones.</p>",
