The first two times bors ran,<code>dist-x86_64-msvc-alt</code> never started, which would (I'm guessing, anyway) have caused CI to hit a timeout if it hadn't been manually halted. The first time someone attempted to halt it, it wouldn't respond to <code>force</code> commands. Eventually, they just closed the pull request and reopened it. The third bors run ended in a regular spurious network failure, which I would guess is unrelated.</p>",
