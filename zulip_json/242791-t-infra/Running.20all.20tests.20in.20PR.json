It only tests the tools if the PR modifies one of the submodules (which now that clippy is no longer a submodule, means it doesn't normally get checked). To test something like clippy, it would be <code>./x.py test src/tools/clippy</code>.  <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/ci/docker/host-x86_64/x86_64-gnu-tools/checktools.sh\">Here</a> is the list of other tools that normally run tests.</p>\n<p>It might be interesting to figure out how often a PR fails just due to clippy.
