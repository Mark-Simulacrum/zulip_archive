Please forgive me if this is an instant \"no\", as I'm super new to the rust compiler and am not really sure what the standards are regarding what is and isn't considered in-scope.

It would be nice to have this automated via git hooks, and would make for a smoother development experience imo.</p>\n<p>Is this something that is worth considering? If not, I understand -- I figured I'd just put this out there in case it was <span aria-label=\"smiley\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f603\" role=\"img\" title=\"smiley\">:smiley:</span> </p>\n<p>Thank you for your time!</p>",
