Often commenting on, or \"approving\" in-progress PRs or things which are otherwise blocked and not doing anything useful.  (Example here: <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/pull/2433#pullrequestreview-591083162\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/pull/2433#pullrequestreview-591083162</a> )</p>\n<p>I'm not sure I can ban them from the rustup repo, but it's getting to the point that I think they possibly ought to be banned from the whole of /rust-lang/ on github.  No amount of complaining to github has resulted in the user behaving themselves.</p>\n<p>If there's a better approach than a ban-hammer I'd be happy to try it.</p>\n<p>D.</p>",
