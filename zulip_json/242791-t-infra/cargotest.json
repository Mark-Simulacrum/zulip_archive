I know there is <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/70659\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/70659</a>, but I was wondering if that went anywhere.</p>\n<p>The reason I ask is because I was thinking of changing it so that it tested with the repo-cargo instead of the bootstrap cargo.  This would be a good way to smoke-test that Cargo actually works.  For context, the Cargo about to ship tonight is broken, and will fail in almost all non-trivial projects.  Would anyone object if I made that change?</p>",
