The CI doesn't set that option, though, so (if I understand correctly) all the tests that rely on clang get ignored. Was that a deliberate decision? Is there room to enable the clang-based tests?<br>\nAt a glance, some might need additional filtering. For example, the test I'm playing with (<code>run-make-fulldeps/cross-lang-lto-clang</code>) also doesn't work on <code>aarch64-apple-darwin</code> but for reasons unrelated to <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/92885\">#92885</a>.</p>",
