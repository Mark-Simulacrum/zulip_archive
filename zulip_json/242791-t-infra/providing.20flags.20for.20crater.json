While features are supposed to be additive (which would let us pass <code>--all-features</code>), some crates have mutually exclusive features. I think it would be great to be able to tell crater what flags we need. Personally, the <code>time</code> crate requires <code>--all-features</code> to be passed. I currently (wrongly) omit tests from <a href=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a>, but even if I didn't it would still fail for this reason.
