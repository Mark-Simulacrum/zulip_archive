So I'm going to open a PR to create one. As far as membership, I was going to populate it with these people as a start:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"216206\">@lcnr</span> (lead)</li>\n<li><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116009\">@nikomatsakis</span> (lead, as lang-team liaison)</li>\n<li><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"121053\">@varkor</span> </li>\n<li><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116107\">@davidtwco</span> </li>\n<li><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"124288\">@oli</span> </li>\n<li><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"256759\">@boats</span> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The intent is to capture folks who've been actively hacking or doing design contribution. These folks will have write access to the repo. If I've overlooked anyone, or you feel you ought <em>not</em> to be included, feel free to ping me and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"216206\">@lcnr</span> =) Don't be shy.</p>",
