I think there are several points that would be worth explicitly noting in the lifecycle.</p>\n<p>For example, it's not clear what happens if code like this is written:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"k\">impl</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Future</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">for</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">MyType</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"k\">type</span> <span class=\"nc\">Output</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">();</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"k\">fn</span> <span class=\"nf\">poll</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"bp\">self</span>: <span class=\"nc\">Pin</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;&amp;</span><span class=\"k\">mut</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Self</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">cx</span>: <span class=\"kp\">&amp;</span><span class=\"nc\">mut</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Context</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>-&gt; <span class=\"nc\">Poll</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"n\">Self</span>::<span class=\"n\">Output</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"n\">cx</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">waker</span><span class=\"p\">().</span><span class=\"n\">wake_by_ref</span><span class=\"p\">();</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"k\">return</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Poll</span>::<span class=\"n\">Pending</span><span class=\"p\">;</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Is this well behaved/reasonable code? Note that the wake call may happen on a separate thread, too, though that's not guaranteed. My expectation would be that this would work fine, and result in the future being polled indefinitely (i.e., essentially busy loop) but be guaranteed to <em>not</em> lead to recursion, that is no stack overflows.</p>",
