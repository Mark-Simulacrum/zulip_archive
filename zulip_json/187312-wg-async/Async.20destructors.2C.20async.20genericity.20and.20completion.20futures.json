It discusses and proposes a design for supporting async destructors, also touching on many async-related topics including async traits and completion futures. I've been thinking about this for a while now so I'm glad to finally share my thoughts and see what other people think. Hopefully I'll eventually turn this into an RFC, but I'd like to get feedback first.</p>",
