It contains a kind of \"synthesized roadmap\" of what we think it would take to make async a joy to use. This is not prioritized yet. The structure is a kind of \"skill tree\", where each section repesents a \"goal\", with a description of what it will feel like when it's achieved along with a list of what work it requires to get there. In some cases, the work is very specific, but in other cases, the work is an open problem, in which case we describe its goals for the most part.  I think that in the final vision doc, each of these sections would basically be a distinct \"shiny future story\".</p>",
