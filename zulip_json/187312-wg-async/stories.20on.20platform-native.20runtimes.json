This relies on a different set of system calls and has different considerations than when writing server workloads.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure how far stories have (or intend to dip into) abstractions such as \"<code>Task</code>\" and \"runtime\", but we probably should probably cover the need to be able to swap backing runtimes by end-users when used in different environments and workloads. This includes WinUI3, but also: Browser WASM, GNOME, precisely tuned servers, and more.</p>\n<div class=\"spoiler-block\"><div class=\"spoiler-header\">\n</div><div class=\"spoiler-content\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n<p>[1]: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/OSYXGyMw9GE\">https://youtu.be/OSYXGyMw9GE</a></p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"OSYXGyMw9GE\" href=\"https://youtu.be/OSYXGyMw9GE\"><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OSYXGyMw9GE/default.jpg\"></a></div></div></div>",
