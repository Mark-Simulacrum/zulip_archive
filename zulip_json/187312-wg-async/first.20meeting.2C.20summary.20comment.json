I'd like your feedback both on its content and on thoughts of where to post. I was thinking of posting to my blog and cross-posting to internals + that locked thread.</p>\n<p>In any case, I was also thinking that we need to take the following organizational steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Write-up the plans to fix each bug</li>\n<li>Initiate some sort of labeling system to record the results of triage<ul>\n<li>For example, perhaps adding <code>AsyncAwait-Blocker</code> and <code>AsyncAwait-NotBlocker</code> labels would be a start, and tagging the issues as appropriate. In NLL, we found this scheme to ultimately be the best. (We might want more categories =)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Document our plans for fixing the blockers in comments on the thread<ul>\n<li>also, we need to be ready to mentor folks should they show up -- <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"127859\">@Taylor Cramer</span> I'd like to know how available you are for that.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",
