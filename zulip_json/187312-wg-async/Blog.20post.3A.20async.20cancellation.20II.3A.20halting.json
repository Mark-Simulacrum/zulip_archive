I noticed some things that were clear to me, might not have translated particularly well to the post. So I took a stab today at a second part to clear them up. </p>\n<p>It's pretty close to the meeting time, so I don't expect anyone to read this. But perhaps this will clear up some questions folks might have had about the original, and it might be worth at least glancing over.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@yoshuawuyts/B1N2cjXZ5\">https://hackmd.io/@yoshuawuyts/B1N2cjXZ5</a></p>",
