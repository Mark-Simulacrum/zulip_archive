The idea is to have a clear chain from the welcome page to the roadmap and any goals or initiatives there that are looking for help. One of the ideas I had was to add a <span aria-label=\"working on it\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f6e0\" role=\"img\" title=\"working on it\">:working_on_it:</span> emoji for each goal/initiative with area-specific how to help or getting started instructions available. I included a link for polish, but I'd love to include links for other areas as well.</p>\n<p>So, if you have instructions for you area already, let me know and I'll be sure to add a link. If you don't have how to help instructions, it'd be great to add some!</p>\n<p>I'm also open to feedback for better ways to organize this information if anyone has ideas.</p>",
