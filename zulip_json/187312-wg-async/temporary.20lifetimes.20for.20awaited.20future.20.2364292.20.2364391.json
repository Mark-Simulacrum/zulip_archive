In particular, I noted that (a) some of the regression reports can be fixed by making the compiler more precise about what is being captured and (b) there is a forwards compatible path to improving all cases, and it would benefit sync code to boot, but it would be a major bit of design work. (In particular, we'd need some mechanism for \"pure drops\" that lets us move drops earlier.)</p>\n<p><strong>After having thought about this for a while, I think that the current order on master is correct, but I wanted to raise it to give people time to object.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>",
