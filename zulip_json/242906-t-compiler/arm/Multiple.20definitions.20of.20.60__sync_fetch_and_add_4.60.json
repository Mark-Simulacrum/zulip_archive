But when I compile with armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf, I get errors about multiple definition of <code>__sync_fetch_and_add_4</code>. I've found a similar issue here: <a href=\"https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=951765\">https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=951765</a> However, the solution of putting <code>--allow-multiple-definition</code> doesn't feel right to me. Does someone have a clue why this is happening and how to sort this out? Thanks!</p>",
