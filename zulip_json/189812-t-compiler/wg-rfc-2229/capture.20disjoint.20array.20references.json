E.g. Having <code>&amp;v[0]</code>, and <code>&amp;mut v[1]</code> at the same time. I was wondering if this is planned to be supported in 2021, or whether it is a future enchancement? It's referenced at the end of the \"Plan\" HackMD, but it doesn't give an indication , other than needing to refactor <code>UpVarListMap</code> to enable the functionality.</p>",
