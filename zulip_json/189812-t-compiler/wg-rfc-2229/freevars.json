These are basically the transcripts from the first closure overview that <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116009\">@nikomatsakis</span>  gave us. For a link to all look <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL85XCvVPmGQh__bxYIxaVifbIOajnrNcQ\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL85XCvVPmGQh__bxYIxaVifbIOajnrNcQ\">here</a>. As you are ramping up on closures implementations, would you mind editing the doc and adding more topics and depth to it and editing the lines that you find unclear. I will do the same. The idea is as we are uncovering the closure implementations for ourselves, we put it all in the paper doc. It will grow up to be a great overview for us and then we can add it as a section in the <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-guide\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-guide\">rustc-guide</a> and help transfer the knowledge. <br>\nI am suggesting paper doc rather than PR on the rustc-guide as it is much more agile to collaborate iterate on a paper doc. <br>\nLet me know what you think about this.</p>",
