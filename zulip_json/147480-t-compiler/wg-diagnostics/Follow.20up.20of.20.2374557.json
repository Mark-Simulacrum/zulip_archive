But as a result, it emits E0425 that shouldn't be emitted ideally (but it's okay for now as it fixes a regression and is beta/stable nominated). I think we could improve the diagnostics, at least not to emit that error. It'd be worth opening another issue for follow-up but I'd like to hear some opinions here from the folks at first :)</p>",
