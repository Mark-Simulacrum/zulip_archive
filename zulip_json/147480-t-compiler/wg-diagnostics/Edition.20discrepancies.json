We have some good 2018 edition lints, but there are cases where errors trigger in 2015 but not 2018 like nll related issues (which we didn't do a good effort in handling gracefully because we focused on people migrating away from 2015, not people reading 2018 docs and trying them out) and some parse errors that work on 2015 but not 2018 without mentioning either raw idents nor editions.</p>",
