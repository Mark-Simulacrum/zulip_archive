I've just opened <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/75138\">#75138</a>, which will close <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/61132\">#61132</a>. It introduces a derive macro to allow structs to be used to define diagnostics (so, you'll be able to do something like <code>tcx.sess.emit_err(FieldAlreadyDeclared{ .. })</code>). It's still work-in-progress, but it's usable, and I'd appreciate some feedback, suggestions and bikeshedding for what I've currently got. Thanks in advance!</p>",
