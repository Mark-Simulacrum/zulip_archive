All further queries in <code>TyCtxt</code> (or the <code>HIR-Map</code>) seem to require a <code>DefId</code> or <code>HirId</code>, and I haven't found a way to get the <code>DefId</code> of a <code>Ty</code>. Also, I'm not sure how to get the implemented traits of a type, <del>should I call <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/ty/struct.TyCtxt.html#method.for_each_relevant_impl\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/ty/struct.TyCtxt.html#method.for_each_relevant_impl\">TyCtxt::for_each_relevant_impl</a> and do the work in a closure?</del> I just realized that this method also receives the <code>DefId</code> of a trait, so it won't give me the impls of <em>all</em> traits of a type, only of <em>one</em>.</p>\n<p>Do I get <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/ty/struct.TyCtxt.html#method.all_traits\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/ty/struct.TyCtxt.html#method.all_traits\">all_traits</a> and then try to find an impl for the type <code>Foo</code> for diagnostics? Seems very wasteful.<br>\nI'd expect there to be a helper function that gives me all traits a type implements... Although I realize that the trait solver is very complicated of course</p>",
