I'm gaining experience with it, and with the style of the language in use, looking at others' reviews of the same content has helped a lot, particularly recently.  However it'd be helpful if I were able to <code>r+</code> those which were ready, when I asked about that, it was suggested <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116009\">@nikomatsakis</span> should make the decision; so, Niko, is there any chance I might be granted the rights for that?</p>\n<p>Otherwise I'll carry on as I have been, thanks for welcoming me in.</p>\n<p>D.</p>",
