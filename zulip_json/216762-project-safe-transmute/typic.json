(Namely, to state that  a<code>UA</code> can be transmuted into a <code>UB</code> if every variant of <code>UA</code> can be transmuted into  _any_ variant of <code>UB</code>.)

This invariant is used to justify which operations safe code can perform. The safety invariant can be temporarily violated by unsafe code, but must always be upheld when interfacing with unknown safe code. It is not relevant when arguing whether some program has UB, but it is relevant when arguing whether some code safely encapsulates its unsafety -- in other words, it is relevant when arguing whether some library is sound.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So I think it is fine to forge an possibly invalid type as long as it doesn't break any validity invariants, like references must always be aligned.  Library invariants don't matter (like <code>Foo.x</code> can never be odd, or <code>Vec.len</code> must not cover uninitialized data. So long as you don't expose this to safe code. Which we don't, only exposed to the <code>Invariants</code> trait, which is <code>unsafe</code> to implement.</p>",

That being said, as I said above, I think the right answer is a combination of both - marker traits provided by typic style compile time information about the type's layout</p>",
