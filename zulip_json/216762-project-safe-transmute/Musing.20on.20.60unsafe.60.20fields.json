Like suppose we had <code>#[repr(transparent)] struct Even(unsafe i32);</code> -- could we take advantage of that to improve the ergonomics of safe transmute too?</p>\n<p>Would we need the same opt-ins anyway, so it wouldn't matter?  Or maybe taking advantage of it mean we'd need trait impls that are sometimes safe but sometimes unsafe, which might just be even more confusing?</p>",
