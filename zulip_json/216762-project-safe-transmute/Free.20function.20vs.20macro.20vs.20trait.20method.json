You wouldn't be able to trust, in generic code, that <code>.transmute_into()</code> is actually a transmute, for example.</p>\n<p>And as mentioned in the other thread, it seems plausible that we might want to enable overlapping impls for these traits, especially allowing people to implement them for specific special cases and something with a trait bound at the same time.  And doing that means making them <code>#[marker]</code> traits eventually, which is only possible with traits that have no associated items.  (Because then there's no ambiguity in which override to use.)</p>",
