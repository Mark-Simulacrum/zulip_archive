This is the problem statement:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since the soundness and safety of a transmutation is affected by the layouts of the source and destination types, changes to those types' layouts may cause code which previously compiled to produce errors. In other words, transmutation causes a type's layout to become part of that type's API for the purposes of SemVer stability.</p>\n<p>The question is, then: <em>how can the author of a type reason about transmutations they did not write, from-or-to types they did not write?</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We have an elegant solution, but the finer details of it need to be explored: <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/anvM3Zy1QSi2bVPQiAK5eg#When-is-a-transmutation-stable\">https://hackmd.io/anvM3Zy1QSi2bVPQiAK5eg#When-is-a-transmutation-stable</a></p>",

It <em>might</em> imply that you won't remove <code>#[repr(C)]</code>, but that's not well-articulated. The presence or lack of <code>#[repr(C)]</code> isn't clearly reflected in rustdoc, so plenty of people assume it doesn't connote any semver obligations.</p>\n<p>And I don't know anyone who thinks it connotes that going from this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"cp\">#[repr(C)]</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"k\">pub</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">struct</span> <span class=\"nc\">Foo</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\">pub</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kt\">u8</span><span class=\"p\">);</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>...to this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"cp\">#[repr(C)]</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"k\">pub</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">struct</span> <span class=\"nc\">Foo</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\">pub</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kt\">u8</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">pub</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kt\">u8</span><span class=\"p\">);</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>...is a breaking change, but for transmutations it might be!
