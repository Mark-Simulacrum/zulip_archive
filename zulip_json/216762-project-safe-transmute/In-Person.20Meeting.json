I think getting together for an hour can help us clarify the use cases we're solving for, what compromises we're willing to make in the interest of shipping something useful faster (even if it might not be the absolute 100% ideal), and which direction we'd like to go for a v1. Please participate in this Doodle to find a time that works for the majority of us. Please also indicate whether you're ok with the group meeting without you or if you believe a meeting should only take place if you can attend: <a href=\"https://doodle.com/poll/xrwxehyh5w9gu8p7\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://doodle.com/poll/xrwxehyh5w9gu8p7\">https://doodle.com/poll/xrwxehyh5w9gu8p7</a></p>",
