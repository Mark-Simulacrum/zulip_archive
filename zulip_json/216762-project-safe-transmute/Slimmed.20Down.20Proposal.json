        "content": "<p>Hey all. Here's a rough draft of a slimmed down proposal similar to the one I posted last (going through a bytes intermediary). This proposal does not attempt to solve the general transmute problem (i.e., transmuting between any two compatible types), but tries to focus on the use case that I'm coming from which is efficient parsing (i.e., you have some buffer of bytes and you need to safely view types inside of that buffer). This will likely not please everyone as there are a lot of valid use cases this does not address, but I hope it seems minimal enough to be a valuable first step.

        "content": "<p>I would agree that it does cover some cases that are of use, yes.</p>\n<p>However, my own experience with data casting usage is that the people kept wanting slice casting and owned casting. Once you have that, doing to and from slices of bytes is just a one liner. That's why the \"to and from bytes\" is the 1.1 afterthought, because you could do it for free in the 1.0 version it just wasn't entirely obvious, and essentially all that the 1.1 version did is add a function to make it more clear how to do that.</p>\n<p>Also, I'm still genuinely unsure of how useful having both to_any_bytes and from_any_bytes as separate traits is. It basically means you can to_any_bytes with references to <code>char</code> and <code>bool</code>, but you can't do it with mut references, and you can't from_any_bytes them. It seems like a very small amount of utility for the complexity of having two traits.</p>",
