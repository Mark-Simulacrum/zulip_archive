Apparently if you specify rustflags in .cargo/config (which I needed for specifying target-features for WASM) and also pass the RUSTFLAGS env var via the command line, cargo will completely silently ignore the .cargo/config. So me passing <code>-Z mutable-noalias=no</code> via the commandline silently turned off crucial target features and which made the whole thing correctly compile in the end. However while cargo completely misled me here, there is indeed a miscompilation going on, so I'm still investigating that one.</p>\n</blockquote>",
