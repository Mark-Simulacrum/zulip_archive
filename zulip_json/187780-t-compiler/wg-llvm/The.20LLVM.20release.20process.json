        "content": "<p>[cross-posting from the Discord as I have been informed that the LLVM gurus have their hideout here :P]</p>\n<p>Background: I'm packaging new-ish versions of Rust for Guix. Due to bootstrapping, we don't just carry the newest version, but also all the older ones up to something that can be built by mrustc. Moreover, as usual for a distro, we build with system-wide LLVM instead of the bundled one.</p>\n<p>When I switched Rust 1.38 onwards to LLVM 9, the tests for Rust 1.41.1 started failing - specifically, the regression test for <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/69225\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/69225\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/69225</a>. I traced this back to this cherry-picked LLVM patch: <a href=\"https://reviews.llvm.org/rG58e8c793d0e43150a6452e971a32d7407a8a7401\" title=\"https://reviews.llvm.org/rG58e8c793d0e43150a6452e971a32d7407a8a7401\">https://reviews.llvm.org/rG58e8c793d0e43150a6452e971a32d7407a8a7401</a></p>\n<p>Which motivates my question - is this a miscompilation in LLVM? If so, why didn't the fix get released as, say 9.0.2? AFAICS, it wasn't available in any released version for half a year, which boggles my mind... am I missing something here?</p>",

I noticed that the faulty commit got reverted on master before 9.0.1 was released. Do you happen to know how LLVM's backporting process looks and where I could look into it, so that I can check whether the commit was excluded on purpose or by accident?</p>",

        "content": "<p>Yes, this seems to be an LLVM bug and I would not be surprised if it didn't see an official release for that long. The official releases are made on a fixed schedule (every six months), and while point releases are an option, they are definitely not issued for every single bug or continously until the next release. It's best to think of official LLVM releases as snapshots that just get some more QA than any random commit, not the be all end all of maintenance and support. I think this is influenced by the fact that a lot of major users and distributors of LLVM based software have their own release schedules and QA and maintenance policies. I know some Linux distributions cherry pick bug fixes into their LLVM packages, looks like you may want to do the same.</p>",
