More specifically, I seem to be unable to set breakpoints inside llvm.<br>\nI'm using <code>lldb</code>. All of the <code>b setDeleteDisposition</code>, <code>b TempFile::keep</code>, <code>b Path.cpp:1198</code> result in the same <code>WARNING:  Unable to resolve breakpoint to any actual locations.</code>, and <code>rustc</code> running happily till the end, not triggering a breakpoint.<br>\nThis happens with both distributed nightlies, and with self-built <code>rustc</code> (I have <code>profile = \"codegen\"</code> in config.toml, but no further changes).<br>\nI would guess the debug info is simply stripped when building LLVM. Is there a way to change that?</p>",
