From some asking around (including <a href=\"https://reviews.llvm.org/rG1e353f092288309d74d380367aa50bbd383780ed#1056245\">on the diffusion revision in phabrciator</a> ) it sounds like unless we're specifically worried about the way the code in that test optimizes (are we?) we should rework the test some so that we can still test the function-merging behavior without relying on that specific optimization. Anyone here have thoughts?</p>",
