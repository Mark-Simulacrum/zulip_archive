I always love how precise wasm spcs are, I wish LLVM (or C or C++) would be even remotely as good.^^<br>\nIn particular, <a href=\"https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/exec/numerics.html#nan-propagation\">this</a> says that most of these operations (basically everything except for a fneg, fabs, or fcopysig) are non-deterministic. This means it would be incorrect for LLVM to change something like</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">let</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">f</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">f1</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">f2</span><span class=\"p\">;</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"n\">function</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">f</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">f</span><span class=\"p\">);</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>to</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">function</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">f1</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">f2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">f1</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">f2</span><span class=\"p\">);</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Basically, LLVM has to specify its own floating-point operations as non-deterministic as well, otherwise compilation to WASM is incorrect.</p>\n<p>Does anyone know if there are circumstances under which LLVM might perform transformations like the above -- transformations that compute a value twice where in the source program it was computed only once?</p>",

In WebAssembly, implementations may do this, however they are not required to. Since IEEE 754-2008 states this as a \"should\" (as opposed to a \"shall\"), it isn't a requirement for IEEE 754-2008 conformance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This answers a lot of questions for <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/73328\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/73328</a></p>\n<p>Specifcally the way it wors is: Certain instructions are not guaranteed to preserve the payload bitpattern (in practice you can't rely on this portably so it seems fine that not to guarantee anything). Specifically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>the instructions fsqrt, fceil, ffloor, ftrunc, fnearest, fadd, fsub, fmul, fdiv, fmin, fmax, promote (<code>f32 as f64</code>) and demote (<code>f64 as f32</code>): : do not preserve the payload or sign bits for non-canonical nans, and do not preserve the sign bit for canonical nans (where \"do not preserve means \"set to a nondeterministic value\").</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the instructions fneg, fabs, and fcopysign (e.g. \"sign bit operations\" according to ieee754) fully preserve nan payload, and only modify the sign bit if expected for the operation, and introduce no nondeterminsim. (this is actually a hard requirement of IEEE754 so it's not surprising if they're going with the \"technically compliant\" argument lol)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All other operations, such as copying values around, loading/storing them to memory, roundtripping arbitrary bitpatterns (including the patterns of noncanonical nans) through float values, using them as args, returning them from functions... these should all preserve sign and payload of nans.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned before you can't portably rely on what happens to these NaN payloads if you do math on them, so I don't think what's there is a big deal if this is followed. My big concern was mostly that that last set of things wouldn't work.</p>",
