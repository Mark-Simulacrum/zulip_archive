I'm debating whether to try for zoom or zulip -- I'm probably ok for either.</p>\n<p>Anyway, one other question would be which things are best to discuss in said meeting. I see two options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>dig into lazy normalization from the chalk perspective (and maybe some about rustc, too)</li>\n<li>step back to look at good next steps for a bigger picture traits wg</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am to do some amount of prep for either/both</p>",
