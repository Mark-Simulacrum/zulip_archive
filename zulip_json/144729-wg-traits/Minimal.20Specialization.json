It seems like there was some disagreement over whether or not this would be useful. I know I've personally wanted/needed specialization many times, and a minimal version like this would unblock many of my use-cases (e.g. making a performance-critical Vec&lt;u8&gt; trait impl fast as compared to a complex Vec&lt;T: SomeTrait&gt; impl, adding a base-case impl for a specific type where all other implementations delegate to that type, allowing casing on sealed traits over a small number of concrete types, etc.). <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"132362\">@Joshua Liebow-Feeser</span>  and I would be interested in working on a proposal for something along these lines, but with the new working-group setup I'd like to make sure we're following the proper order of things WRT gathering working-group consensus and prioritization.</p>\n<p>Are there others who would be interested in participating in this effort? Does this seem like something you'd be interested in prioritizing? (relative to other roadmap language features)</p>",

The post even included a (relatively) simple concept of \"always applicable\" (not the more general, always applicable relative to base impl).</li>\n<li>I think a good first step would be identify the concrete use cases, and then trying to see whether we can accommodate them with something like always applicable<br>\n    - I haven't thought about this in a bit, but of course the question is whether we can implement the idea in the compiler's existing trait system or if we really want something more like chalk to handle it</li>\n<li>I definitely this working group is the right place to be doing this. I also think this topic is misnamed, and we should instead organize it something like this (or perhaps just mix both into one stream):<br>\n    - wg-traits/t-compiler<br>\n    - wg-traits/t-lang</li>\n<li>I think there is some room to expand our focus. In particular, we're very light on the \"extending chalk\" side of things. The main thing we're needing is some <em>leadership</em> there -- if <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"127859\">@Taylor Cramer</span> wants to provide it, I think pursuing specialization makes a lot of sense.</li>\n<li>I would prototype the ideas in chalk to prove them out and provide the \"official semantics\", but I don't think that will be all that hard</li>\n</ul>",

We use specialization to add type-specific behavior to various generic functions.<br>\n- We have a proc macro for most use cases: <a href=\"https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/master/garnet/bin/recovery_netstack/core/specialize-ip-macro/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/master/garnet/bin/recovery_netstack/core/specialize-ip-macro/\">https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/master/garnet/bin/recovery_netstack/core/specialize-ip-macro/</a>.
