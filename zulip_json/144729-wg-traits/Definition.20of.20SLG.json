SLG seems like a prime candidate for the book's glossary, so is there a better definition available?</p>\n<p>(aside: according to the blog post the SLG solver is supposed to be the next best thing, but recently I've seen talk of replacing it with the former recursive resolver?)</p>\n<p>Edit: zulip doesn't like markdown reference links</p>",
