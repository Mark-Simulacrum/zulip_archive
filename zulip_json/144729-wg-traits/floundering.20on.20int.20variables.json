Problem is, since in RA (and rustc) all traits are non-enumerable, we flounder. I think we shouldn't do that, when the variable is an int/float variable?</p>\n<p>With the recursive solver, I think there's the additional complication that I don't think we can even tell the variable kind from the clauses code, since it's just a BoundVar. Maybe we need to instantiate before calling the clauses code after all <span aria-label=\"thinking\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f914\" role=\"img\" title=\"thinking\">:thinking:</span></p>",
