        "content": "<p>So, I'm entirely sure what we should discuss today.</p>\n<p>Last week, we had a zoom meeting where we decided that we wanted to make the focus of 2021 be \"async fn in traits\", with that encompassing a few different features: 1) Named impl trait 2) GATs with lifetimes 3) Some impl trait lifetime inference extensions 4) Possibly extending GATs with non-lifetime types 5) Possibly other kinds of sugar</p>\n<p>I think we also decided that the next steps would be to \"take stock\" of the current state of the features and decide on their next steps. We probably expected this bit to be async. But we could also just a spend a meeting each for named impl trait and GATs to go over them. This might require a bit of prep work from someone (likely me or <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116009\">@nikomatsakis</span>, maybe <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116118\">@Matthew Jasper</span>) in terms of going over the relevant RFC, looking at current relevant issues, looking at relevant tests, and maybe just playing with some code. All in order to \"get prepared\" to help drive the discussion.</p>\n<p>For this meeting though, maybe if might be best to just give <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116009\">@nikomatsakis</span> an hour of sync discussion about the open PRs on his plate to review <span aria-label=\"stuck out tongue wink\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f61c\" role=\"img\" title=\"stuck out tongue wink\">:stuck_out_tongue_wink:</span> I would actually like some sync conversation on the rustc binder refactor, but that doesn't necessarily have to be in this meeting.</p>\n<p>Anyways, open to thoughts here from <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116009\">@nikomatsakis</span> or others</p>",
