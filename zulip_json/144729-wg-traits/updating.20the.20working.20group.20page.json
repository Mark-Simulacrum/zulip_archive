At the start of each sprint, we identify a set of goals and work towards them. During the sprint, we have a \\[dropbox paper document\\] that lists out the goals. During the weekly triage meeting, we try to update the doc with information on our progress. So if you're curious to know what we're up to right now, check out the doc for our current sprint.</p>",
