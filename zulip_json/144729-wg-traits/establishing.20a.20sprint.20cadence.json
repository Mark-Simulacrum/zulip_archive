        "content": "<p>I've become quite intrigued by the idea of doing more organized <strong>sprints</strong>. Roughly speaking, the idea would be this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Every 6 weeks, we have a special meeting (perhaps it is longer) in which we pick particular goals, which we should be able to connect to some of our larger themes.<br>\n    - why 6 weeks? Rust release cycle.</li>\n<li>In between those meetings, we hold shorter sync meetings (like the ones we have now) in which we follow up on those goals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The idea of the longer meeting is it includes time to review how things went and to decide if we want to continue pursuing the <strong>same set</strong> of goals, or something different. </p>\n<p>We might consider doing the sprint meetings over Zoom, although I think I've found that Zulip can be surprisingly high bandwidth, and I know it's better for some folks (e.g., due to language barriers, bandwidth constraints, or other things). So I'd be game to stick with Zulip. </p>\n<p>I feel like we already had a sort of informal \"first sprint\" meeting some weeks ago, can't recall the precise date. We could kind of \"retcon\" a sprint from that starting point. Or we could use this coming Monday to do a first sprint meeting.</p>",
