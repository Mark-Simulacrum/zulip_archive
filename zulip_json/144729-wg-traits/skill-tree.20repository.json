I'd be fine transferring it to rust-lang, which would have some advantages because I could (eg) bother folks on infra team to tend to it, but it feels a bit premature to me, maybe? I could also move it to its own org.. or maybe it's fine where it is for now. Just wanted to throw out there that I don't really care that much where it lives so if anyone has a suggestion, I wouldn't mind hearing it.</p>",
