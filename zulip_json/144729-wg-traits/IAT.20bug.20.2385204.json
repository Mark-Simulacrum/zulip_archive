Could someone do some basic evaluation on whether this would be beginner-friendly?(If there's some basic mentoring notes that would be great)</p>",

To be honest, I'm inclined not to do it right now, because it's kind of a cross-cutting thing and I'd rather wait until some of the other initiatives are more underway. If you have energy, maybe we could direct at towards some of the blockers around named impl trait or GATs?</p>",
