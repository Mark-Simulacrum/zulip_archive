I've been trying to glean some understanding of the current status and direction of travel for specialization, but haven't been able to find much written on the subject since <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"301292\">@Aaron Turon</span>'s April 2018 blog post <a href=\"http://aturon.github.io/tech/2018/04/05/sound-specialization/\">Sound and ergonomic specialization for Rust</a>; I'm aware that <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/68970\">Implement a feature for a sound specialization subset</a> happened last year and that libs have since been moving over to use that, but it appears that that feature follows the design sketched out in <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116009\">@nikomatsakis</span>'s February 2018 blog post <a href=\"http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2018/02/09/maximally-minimal-specialization-always-applicable-impls/\">Maximally minimal specialization: always applicable impls</a> instead, upon which Aaron's post had some ideas for improvement.  That said, <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/unstable-book/language-features/min-specialization.html\">the feature's entry in the unstable book</a> just links to the main specialization tracking issue without saying much more on the subject so I might have it completely wrong and/or the entire design approach may have moved on significantly from those blog posts in early 2018.  Are there some further blog posts or discussion that I'm missing and that would give a sense of the current status and  direction of travel for this feature?</p>",
