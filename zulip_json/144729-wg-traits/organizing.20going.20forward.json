There are perhaps a few entangled questions.</p>\n<p>One idea I wanted to kickout was to setup a standing \"meeting time\" where we can dig into one particular issue, but the focus rotates. In my mind's eye, I imagine that we have some various goals we are trying to work towards, and each week we pick one of those to talk out. The person working on it describes what they've done and whatever problem they're stuck on. Then we try to talk it out and fix it, and we use this as a chance to \"spread knowledge\" about how the thing they're doing to do works and generally build up the group.  (Honestly, since I'm trying to spend Monday/Friday on this effort, I could even do this more than once a week if it proves useful.)</p>\n<p>Of course, the other thing to discuss is what goals we should have and how many. Right now there's kind of a lot of stuff going on, which is awesome, but I would like to kind of list it out and get that a bit more..organized.</p>",

Obviously there can only be so many of these and they would be dedicated to important projects.  The expectation is that \"mentees\" will stick around as \"people hacking more independently\" afterwards (i.e., require less support over time).</li>\n<li>There is still room for more occasional contribution but I think it would be more of the \"fix this ICE\" or \"make this small change\" variety. </li>\n<li>But maybe it's easier to just schedule some 1-on-1s and play it by ear?</li>\n</ul>",
