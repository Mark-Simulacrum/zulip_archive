I'm looking at <code>process_obligations</code> and <code>mark_successes</code> in particular.</p>\n<p>It strikes me as odd that the latter only transitions nodes back to <code>Waiting</code> if they have subobligations in the <code>Pending</code> state. I would think that subobligations that end up being in the <code>Waiting</code> state should cause obligations that depend on them to transition back to <code>Waiting</code> as well. What am I missing?</p>\n<p>Also, do we expect the ObligationForest code to be replaced with Chalk code in the near future? Just curious if it's worthwhile to spend time in this area.</p>",
