The issue closed by <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/90819\">#90819</a> caused an ICE because the suggestion code was calling <code>predicate_must_hold</code> on a <code>TraitPredicate</code> with a <code>TraitRef</code> that provided only a self type in its substitutions (ie the length of <code>trait_ref.substs</code> was one), even if the trait had generic parameters. I assume this is not supposed to be allowed. Unfortunately, this did not set off an ICE until the trait in question happened to be <code>Unsize</code>. That seems not great, so I would like to prevent this from happening in the future by adding an appropriate assert somewhere that does a basic check to make sure this type of malformed obligation ICEs, but I'm not sure where the best place for it is, or if this is the best strategy. If anyone more familiar with the code could give a suggestion here, that would be appreciated.</p>",
