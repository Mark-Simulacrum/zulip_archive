Chalk underpins pretty much every interesting feature in rust-analyzer, so, when it breaks, almost nothing works, and improving that would lead to a significant improvement in the experience for end devs. Note that we are not as sensitive to wrong answers -- wrong answer is a local, isolated failure.</p>",
