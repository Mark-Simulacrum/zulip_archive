Inspired by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116009\">@nikomatsakis</span>, I was wondering if everyone might be interested in having a meeting sometime early next week to discuss 2021 as a retrospective. Basically, what did we accomplish, what didn't we finish that we wanted to, and I suppose also what our goals for next year are (high-level, of course; I'm not thinking of this as planning meeting).</p>\n<p>I would be interested in doing a zoom meeting if people are interested, but text also works. I think we've been really productive this year and I'd love to hear people brag about what they've done <span aria-label=\"wink\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f609\" role=\"img\" title=\"wink\">:wink:</span></p>",
