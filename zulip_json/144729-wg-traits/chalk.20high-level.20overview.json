I didn't quite get the diagram I wanted up yet, but I was working on this, which seemed promising:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/16761362-0a6d-41e3-8513-9e22008052fe\" title=\"https://www.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/16761362-0a6d-41e3-8513-9e22008052fe\">Diagram: chalk-rust-ir</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>My original goal to kind of depict the \"big picture\" of how chalk works. i.e., there is rust sources, they get converted to datums by rustc, and then chalk can get those via the <code>RustIrDatabase</code> and convert them to program clauses, and then those clauses can be used to solve goals. But I kind of got into depicting how the datums are structured, and then I thought...if this were to be finished, it'd be pretty useful too. Thoughts?</p>",
