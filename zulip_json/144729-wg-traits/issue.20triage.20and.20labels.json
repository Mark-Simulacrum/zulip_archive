        "content": "<ul>\n<li>Issues I feel are most useful when there is a \"actionable goal\", specifically something that could, theoretically, be closed with a pull request (but not always). So, an obvious example of this is <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk/issues/341\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk/issues/341\">https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk/issues/341</a>. It's a very discrete type of goal, with a clear endpoint. A less obvious example of this would be <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk/issues/318\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk/issues/318\">https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk/issues/318</a>. This one doesn't necesarily have a <em>clear</em> endpoint (since it really stems from an observation from invalid state). But it does have reproduction steps (even though they are a bit outdated because we no longer truncate). Nevertheless, it remains something that can be investigated. But is also (because we don't truncate anymore), I wouldn't be upset if it was closed. Another example of issue that we don't really have right now, but I think is also <em>ok</em> is a \"tracking issue\" (e.g. rustc integration). The obvious endpoint would be rustc using Chalk as <em>the</em> trait solver. In general, issues are a good place to briefly summarize mentoring guidelines, progress, and a \"list\" of things to do. And this is doubly so since that's generally the <em>first</em> place people go to look if they \"want to get involved\".</li>\n</ul>",
