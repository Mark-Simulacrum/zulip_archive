We obviously don't want to have a <code>GeneratorWitness</code> carry around the entire <code>InferCtxt</code> from its parent function. I think we need to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Determine which region constraints are 'relevant' (from <code>RegionConstraintCollector</code>).</li>\n<li>Extract them from the <code>InferCtxt</code>, and re-write them to use the late-bound variables used by the witness type.</li>\n<li>When <code>SelectionContext</code> processes a <code>GeneratorWitness </code>predicate, create fresh inference variables in the <code>SelectionContext</code>'s <code>InferCtxt</code>, and apply the stored constraints the new inference variables.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>However, I've not that familiar with how region inference works, so I might be missing something.</p>",
