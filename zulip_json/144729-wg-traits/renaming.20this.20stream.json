The idea being that the \"t-compiler\" stream is for implementation-focused questions, and \"t-lang\" more for \"design-focused\" ones, but that working group members would be expected to keep up with both. Alternatively, maybe we just want to have one stream (<code>#wg-traits</code>).</p>\n<p>Thoughts?</p>\n<p>(And, cc <span class=\"user-group-mention\" data-user-group-id=\"1095\">@WG-meta</span>)</p>",
