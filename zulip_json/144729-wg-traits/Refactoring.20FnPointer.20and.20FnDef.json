(see <a href=\"https://github.com/memoryleak47/chalk/commit/8a029b5c4afeaaccadf2f6ebcdfc2c633e8d29ac\">https://github.com/memoryleak47/chalk/commit/8a029b5c4afeaaccadf2f6ebcdfc2c633e8d29ac</a>)<br>\nBut now I wonder what <em>logic</em> code duplication the issue is actually referring to.</p>\n<p>Also, I copied #[allow(missing_docs)] from the original struct over to FnSig. Is that a bad idea?</p>",
