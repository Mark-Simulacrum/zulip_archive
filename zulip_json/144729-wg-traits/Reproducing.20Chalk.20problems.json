Should I just try to manually minimize them to a rust-analyzer test-case? </p>\n<p>Or should we invest into some kind of tracing/bug-reproducing architecture for Chalk? I imagine if I could just dump everything chalks looks at into JSON, the minization would be faster then from-source minimization?</p>",
