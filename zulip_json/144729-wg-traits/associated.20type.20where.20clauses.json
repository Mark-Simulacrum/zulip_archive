The reason seems to be that we include the where clauses of the trait in the where clauses for its associated type, which leads to a cycle that otherwise wouldn't happen (the <code>Normalize</code> rule requires the where clauses of the associated type, but not the trait). Are the <code>where_clauses</code> in <code>AssociatedTyDatum</code> not supposed to include the trait's where clauses?
