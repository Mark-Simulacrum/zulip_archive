My initial thought was that since the list of conflicting traits is already known, it should be possible to iterate through them and choose the trait that typechecks. This would only be the case if exactly one works, with the case for zero and multiple being status quo.</p>\n<p>My use case for this is really the same as any other function/method overloading. But specifically, in my rewrite of the time crate, I have the <a href=\"https://time-rs.github.io/time/time/trait.NumericalDuration.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://time-rs.github.io/time/time/trait.NumericalDuration.html\">NumericalDuration</a> and <a href=\"https://time-rs.github.io/time/time/trait.NumericalStdDurationShort.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://time-rs.github.io/time/time/trait.NumericalStdDurationShort.html\">NumericalStdDurationShort</a> traits, which vary only in return type. It would be great to be able to have them both in scope and do <code>std::thread::sleep(5.seconds())</code> and have the compiler realize that only one trait in scope is capable of typechecking there. Right now, the workaround is to do <code>std::thread::sleep(5.std_seconds())</code>, which is...not as pretty.</p>\n<p>Thoughts? I was thinking of writing an RFC, but not if there's zero chance of this happening.</p>",
