I think this could be replaced with some standard logging crate, except for the (rather invaluable) services it has for nesting and things. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"124288\">@oli</span> -- didn't you have some crate that \"bolted on\" nesting to std::log? I wonder if we could actually go further and really improve our debugging infrastructure</p>",
