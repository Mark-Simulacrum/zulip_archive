Now what we want, is to make test, checking that when something in <code>RusIrDatabase</code> panics, then panic is properly forwarded, and the <code>Solver::solve</code> panics too. </p>\n<p>I understand your concerns with creating actual Db for the test, as we want just a simple panicking, implementation of <code>RustIrDatabase</code> (or returning something valid but without an actual meaning). Being honest I very don't like a <code>Mock</code> name for this - it is a <code>Stub</code>, or <code>Fake</code> object, but not mock (I find mock as something with highly customizable calls, which allows to check what was happening with it during the test). However I would not fight for naming and follow whatever convention is in there, if there is some.</p>\n<p>My only concern here is how to create a <code>Solver</code> properly - I see this is some kind of salsa trait which allows to return this, but i don't see any implementation of that - I suppose <code>#[salsa::query_group(...)]</code> does a job, but I never used salsa before, so I will need to went into that to understand the API (I know the concept of salsa on some level).</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"232957\">@Jack Huey</span> am I on right track?

        "content": "<p>Ok, I went a little deeper into that and I think I see what happens there. You pointed me almost directly into a problem. In <code>logic.rs</code> you are actually creating some new table, and trying to fullfill it with some initial data in <code>Forest::push_initial_strands</code>, but it fails, if something  panics internally (in particular: when there is a panic in database). What happens is, that the table is in invalid state (in terms: it is not filled properly), but next time <code>Forest::solve</code> is called (which is called directly from <code>Solver::solve</code>), the table is just taken from call it \"cache\" - without any  retry of pushing initial strands, so it is just an invalid table in this context.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The \"functional\" way of solving the issue would be not to insert a table unless it is properly initialized. Making quick review I see, that calls are pretty simple:<ul>\n<li><code>push_initial_strands</code> - this guy uses <code>table_goal</code>, but we don't need to insert table to have it - we are inserting it into the table</li>\n<li><code>push_initial_strands_instantiated</code> - here magic happens, but first thing which is done is taking mutable borrow to the just inserted table; as I assume, that there are no nasty unsafes here, I am pretty much confident, that nothing uses the <code>tables</code> until all strands are inserted, so we don't need it to be in the tables yet</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The \"catch an exception\" way which I hate - the whole <code>push_initial_strands_instantiated</code> call can be wrapped into <code>catch_unwind</code> call, so when some panic happens here, the table is removed from tables.</li>\n<li>The \"mark when done\" approach, is to add some marker to the tables, which indicates if table is properly configured. Initially the marker would be set on <code>false</code> (or some <code>enum</code> to improve readability), then just after <code>push_initial_strands</code> returns, the marker is set to <code>true</code>.  On <code>logic.rs:216</code> additional check would be added - if table is not valid, <code>push_initial_strands</code> is called on it again. The problem with this approach (despite the additional overhead which is probably unnoticeable) is, that I am not really sure that calling <code>push_initial_strands</code> on partially filled table is a good idea - I suppose, that the final state of the table can become a mess.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For now I would like to proceed with my \"functional\" approach as I find it the cleanest one and I don't see why it doesn't work. However I am not very much aware about how exactly Chalk works, and I don't exactly know what is \"the NFTD paper\" referenced in doc-comment above so I cannot exactly verify what is going on in there (however I have a brief idea how Prolog interpreters work, so I can imagine the approach basics).</p>\n<p>I just wanted to leave this here so if anyone sees any major missunderstanding on my side, may raise some alert here, as I am pretty much new here.</p>",
