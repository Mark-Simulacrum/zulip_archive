I've created <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15OkcSFXIeYPUhJrFWfDaKme-crUJ89hERrUF2n4FVSI/edit?usp=sharing\" title=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15OkcSFXIeYPUhJrFWfDaKme-crUJ89hERrUF2n4FVSI/edit?usp=sharing\">this spreadsheet</a> that contains I think a fairly complete list of the types in chalk-ir and their counterparts in rustc. There are a number of places where the names disagree. I'd sort of like to have the names match up better, and I'd like to discuss if this is an opportunity to clarify some of the naming schemes.</p>\n<p>Some of the things to settle on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>chalk uses the <code>Data</code> suffix, where rustc uses <code>Kind</code> (e.g., <code>TyData</code> vs <code>TyKind</code>)</li>\n<li>what to call <code>TraitRef</code>, which seems to be quite confusing?</li>\n<li>what to call a <code>Substitution</code>?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anyway, I've started putting in a few notes, and made the spreadsheet open for comments, so you can leave comments with thoughts.</p>",
