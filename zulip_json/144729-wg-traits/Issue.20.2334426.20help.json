I'm trying to look into why <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/34426\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/34426\">#34426</a> is happening since it's an issue that's preventing my code from compiling, and I <em>think</em> I've found what's causing the problem, but I'm not entirely sure what the proper solution for it is.</p>\n<p>looking at <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_typeck/check/dropck.rs#L143-L237\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_typeck/check/dropck.rs#L143-L237\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_typeck/check/dropck.rs#L143-L237</a>, it seems that for HRTB clauses, the RegionKind::ReLateBound in the HRTB's Predicate::Trait variant isn't getting properly normalized, leading to the issue. My first guess for solving this would be to try and use the same trait-bound checking mechanisms used elsewhere in the codebase (which seems to be the traits::fulfill machinery), but I think the comment at 198 says that that doesn't work.</p>\n<p>However, I don't understand what exactly that comment is saying. What exactly are outlives predicates and region inference constraints, and why is it bad to turn the first into the second?</p>",
