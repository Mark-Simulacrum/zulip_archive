I tried to sketch out a write-up of my thoughts and ideas <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/roRq0qHMQ6CyRJxj_FsPSQ\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://hackmd.io/roRq0qHMQ6CyRJxj_FsPSQ\">in this hackmd</a> and I'd love feedback. This is both introducing the rough ideas of how chalk represents types (and why) and also sketching out  a plan to </p>\n<ul>\n<li>migrate rustc to have a similar API</li>\n<li>extract a crate from rustc with few dependencies</li>\n<li>make chalk depend on that crate</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that this is a bit different than what we've said before, which was to make rustc depend on chalk initially. I think we can actually do that <strong>too</strong> -- and just move the two things closer together until the different disappears. But I think that ultimately rustc is enough code that we have to migrate it bit by bit to be closer to chalk. (This migration bit is an interesting thing worth discussing more detail, I think.)</p>",
