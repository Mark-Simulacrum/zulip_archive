I had some free time last week, and put together a different framework with less obvious unsafety, <a href=\"https://github.com/frankmcsherry/columnation\">https://github.com/frankmcsherry/columnation</a>, but I thought it might be reasonable to exercise any unsafe code guidelines you might have. In particular, it does some things that are <code>unsafe</code>, but may or may not be UB depending on .. I don't know aliasing rules ... something. The intent, as always, is that it is not unsafe, but if you'd like someone to read through what you have and attempt to make something safe as a result I'm available to try that out.</p>",

ColumnStack just holds a Vec of Ts and a Region, and when someone tries to push something onto the stack, it just makes a bitwise copy of it, and calls the Region's Copy with a mutable reference to that copy. The Region takes care of doing a \"deep copy\" of the pointers that the input holds, and then overwrites the input with pointers into that storage. Then the Stack's copy() appends it to it's Vec (And it takes care to never Drop the elements in it)<br>\nFor Copy types copy() is implemented empty. And Vec/String keep a Vec&lt;Vec&lt;_&gt;&gt; where they actually store things. The inner Vecs never realloc such that the pointers in T's in the Stack don't get invalidated. It attempts to reuse storage in existing Vecs, and when they run out just makes a new one (with powers-of-two growth at the moment)</p>\n<p>The point of this is that if you have a nested type such as Vec&lt;Vec&lt;String&gt;&gt; and you replace it with  ColumnStack&lt;Vec&lt;String&gt;&gt; you can store all the inner String structs contiguously (Kind of contigously because of the Vec&lt;Vec&lt;_&gt;&gt; thing mentioned above) and all the data for String's (Stored as u8's) contigously</p>\n<p>Sent a pull request with a bug fix (If I understand it correctly, apologies if I misunderstood something)</p>",
