I've got a <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/dziXCP2uRkaUKMzpoICxjg\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://hackmd.io/dziXCP2uRkaUKMzpoICxjg\">draft announcement here</a>, which currently reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p># Unsafe code guidelines working group sync</p>\n<p>The first <strong>lang-team working group sync</strong> will be taking place this coming Thursday, March 14. The meeting concerns the <strong>Unsafe Code Guidelines</strong> working group. We will be presenting this <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/blob/master/working-groups/unsafe-code-guidelines/NOTES.md#update-from-march-14-2019\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/blob/master/working-groups/unsafe-code-guidelines/NOTES.md#update-from-march-14-2019\">write-up of the current status and plans</a>. The goal of the meeting is both to inform the lang-team and broader community about what we've been up to, and to gather feedback on the overall direction -- not so much to debate technical minutia, though that too could happen. =)</p>\n<p>This is an <strong>open meeting</strong>. It will be held over <a href=\"https://zoom.us/j/458894176\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://zoom.us/j/458894176\">Zoom</a> and will be recorded and posted to YouTube after the fact. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I hope that you all can make it!</p>",
