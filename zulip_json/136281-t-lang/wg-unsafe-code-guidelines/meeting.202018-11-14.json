I would sort of like to stay focused on the discussion area -- some things on my mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is left for our <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-rfcs/unsafe-code-guidelines/pulls\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-rfcs/unsafe-code-guidelines/pulls\">pending pull requests</a> to be merged? </li>\n<li>What should our plan be for opening RFCs regarding conclusions we have made thus far? When is a good point?<br>\n    - Maybe once we have \"representation + validity invariants\" together?</li>\n<li>What should our next topic be and who is going to prep the writeup that divides it into issues etc?<br>\n    - I suspect validity invariants, right? (Er, what did <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"120791\">@RalfJ</span> call this?)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some other things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Process review: I feel like the process if \"ok\" but the pace is too slow, but I'm not sure what to do about it. Investing more time, maybe, but who's time? This is partly why I want to move to weekly meetings.</li>\n<li>Face-to-face discussion: I've been wondering about trying to organize a dedicated get-together at some point. I'd like to have a concrete goal -- maybe after we've got a few more things on our belt. Basically some way for us to inject some face time to move to consensus more quickly.<br>\n    - I thought about doing this at the Rust All Hands but I worry that it will just be too chaotic, maybe better to organize something separate.</li>\n</ul>",
