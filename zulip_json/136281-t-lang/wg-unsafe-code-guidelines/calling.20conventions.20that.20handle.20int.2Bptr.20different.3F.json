It's also UB to cast pointers to another type if they're misaligned, which is easier to do by accident if you start with <code>void *</code>.  On the other hand, if <code>uintptr_t</code> exists, round tripping <code>void *</code> to <code>uintptr_t</code> and back is at least guaranteed to produce a pointer that compares equal to the original, so it seems like it would be preferable.  But then I learned CHERI was a thing and realized that 'compares equal' isn't necessarily the same thing as 'is equivalent', if the round trip strips runtime provenance. (Though in practice CHERI uses 128-bit <code>uintptr_t</code> and tries not to strip runtime provenance, I think?)  Oh well.
