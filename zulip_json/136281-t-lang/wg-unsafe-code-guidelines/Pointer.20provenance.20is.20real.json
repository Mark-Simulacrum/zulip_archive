I personally would be very surprised if that was possible (as you know since this came up in some issue or Zulip thread before), but this is certainly worth exploring. In particular I am worried by the complexities arising from having local variables inside a function not be stored in memory but in some other, non-addressable location. This could mean that local variables follow very different rules depending on whether they have their address taken or not, which seems... odd at least. (By \"possible\" I mean getting a compiler that can compete in terms of performance and has comprehensible rules; defining the model itself of course is very possible.)</p>",

The latter must be justified against the former. Both alias analysis and range analysis are examples of the latter.<br>\nbut if you define your operational semantics without provenance, then there will be much fewer \"doesn't alias\" results that the alias analysis can correctly return. provenance is about adding more UB to the language so that alias analysis can more often say \"doesn't alias\" without being wrong.</p>",
