The \"freeze\" operation is the same as in <a href=\"https://www.cs.utah.edu/~regehr/papers/undef-pldi17.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.cs.utah.edu/~regehr/papers/undef-pldi17.pdf\">this paper</a>, and its semantics basically is to turn the uninitialized parts of that memory into some non-deterministic fixed bit pattern. Since any fixed bit pattern is valid in a <code>&amp;mut [u8]</code>, an uninitialized array can be passed to <code>Read::read</code> after freezing.<br>\nThe main problem here is actually implementing this function in LLVM, but their realization was that <code>black_box</code>, i.e. an empty <code>volatile memory</code> assembly block, should have this effect.</p>\n<p>What do you think of this plan?
