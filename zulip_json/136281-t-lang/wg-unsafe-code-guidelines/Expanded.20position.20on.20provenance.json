Thanks to all who commented, or who participated in discussions otherwise.</p>\n<p>I fixed a bunch of things / improved terminology, and clarified that MVP CHERI should be strict-provenance only. I still think there's value for some polyfills for <code>ptr.expose_addr()</code> and <code>std::ptr::from_exposed</code> that work on Rust-allocated pointers, so I've improved and worked them out in more detail and I explain why it's still better than x64. (No more double pointers.)</p>\n<p>If you have thoughts, feel free to write them here or on HackMD, but it seems HackMD messes up the comment locations sometimes.</p>",
