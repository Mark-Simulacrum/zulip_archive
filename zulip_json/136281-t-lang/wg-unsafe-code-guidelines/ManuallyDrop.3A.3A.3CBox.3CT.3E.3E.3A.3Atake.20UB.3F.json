This is working out great for me, except I need it as a <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> when it comes to actually <code>drop</code> it. <code>drop(&amp;mut self)</code> makes this slightly annoying. What I'm doing is using <code>ManuallyDrop::take</code>, which seems designed for this exact case... but I vaguely remember rules about Box's inner <code>Unique</code> having weird LLVM requirements, and if i use <code>ManuallyDrop::take</code>, I will have both a <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> and a <code>ManuallyDrop&lt;Box&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> that refer to the same location and are both \"active\" (for lack of  a better term) even though the latter I never intend to touch again. Just wanted to check, is this UB, or am I good?</p>",
