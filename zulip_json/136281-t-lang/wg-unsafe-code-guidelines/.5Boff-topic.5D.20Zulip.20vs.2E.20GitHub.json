The major complaint I've seen about GitHub is that it's hard for someone to jump in and review the previous discussion, due to large volumes of text (plus the GitHub-specific issue where it tends to hide posts).  But in that respect, surely something like Zulip, where, due to its focus on real-time communication, people tend to write significantly larger amounts of text – with lower information density and less time spent reviewing the text for accuracy/relevance before sending it – is even worse.  I don't want to get into a long argument or anything (there is enough heat and noise in the strict_provenance discussion without meta discussions).  But I'm legitimately puzzled why people prefer Zulip...</p>",
