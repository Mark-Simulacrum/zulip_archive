I was posted the article mostly because it surprised me with the extent of the optimizations that exist and talk of locking down repr(Rust) makes me nervous that people are trying to make programmers' lives easier for certain niche struct-hacking use cases without considering the extent of the performance loss. But I think I misread the room.</p>",
