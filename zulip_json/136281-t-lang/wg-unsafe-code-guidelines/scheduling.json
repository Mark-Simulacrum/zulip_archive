Obviously the last few weeks it seems like everyone's been busy. I'm inclined to schedule the wg-meta meeting in that slot, which means I'd be unavailable for meetings here, but we can either reschedule that (which I think isn't necessarily a great time) or I can try to catch up.</p>\n<p>In any case, I think we probably ought to talk about \"how organized\" to get.</p>",
