It seems like the answer is \"basically everything we've done so far\" -- though there are some exceptions. I think we agreed to try and make a list somewhere? Perhaps in an issue? I started trying to open one and it didn't quite feel right though -- it seemed like the answer was sort of \"everything plus the open issues\". Maybe we should just revisit this once we are done with validity invariants and try to make up the list <em>then</em>?</p>",
