        "content": "<p>So I have an <code>ncurses</code> style situation. I want to have a struct that represents \"the terminal\", and it will have exclusive control over the input and output handling while it's around. Naturally, Rust puts us in a thread-safe position for this with the <code>StdinLock</code>, <code>StdoutLock</code>, and <code>StderrLock</code> setup. However, each of these locks holds a lifetime back to their handle. So you'd have a struct with three lifetimes to some outer scope the terminal is stuck in. It would be a lot easier if the terminal could just hold all of the stuff at once and then it can just move around without worry. Which brings us to questions about how we could package up the handles with the locks.</p>\n<p>(For the purposes of everything I'm about to say, I'm aware that the internals of the standard library are not a stable part of the API. I'm willing to accept that some future version of the standard library might change a detail in here, I just want it to be sound with respect to current Rust.)</p>\n<p>So my main thought was that we can just transmute the lock from lock&lt;'a&gt; into lock&lt;'static&gt;, wrap both the handle and the lock into ManuallyDrop, and then have the drop code for this bundle first drop the lock, then drop the handle. </p>\n<p>The handles themselves are of the form <code>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;BufReader&lt;Maybe&lt;StdinRaw&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>, and the lock is a <code>MutexGuard&lt;'a, BufReader&lt;Maybe&lt;StdinRaw&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>. The <code>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;...&gt;&gt;</code> itself is kept, lazily initialized, <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/std/io/stdio.rs.html#242-259\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/std/io/stdio.rs.html#242-259\">in a static inside the stdin function</a>.</p>\n<p>Given what I want to accomplish, does this sound like a sane sort of thing to do? Is there some better way to do it?</p>",
