So we can copy it around like so:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>g1 = m1 --&gt; v1(g2)\ng2 = m2 --&gt; v2(g3)\ng3 = m3 --&gt; v3(g1)\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Here I'm putting <code>g1</code> in node <code>v3</code> by just copying it in. Note that the graph of derived references is still acyclic. When we want to access one of these nodes, we put say <code>g2</code> on the local stack, and deref it to get <code>m2</code>. This invalidates any other references derived from <code>m2</code> or <code>v2</code>, but luckily there aren't any; we have <code>g2</code> stored in <code>v1</code> but that's just a pointer derived from <code>m2</code>, which we're currently using and is still valid. We can make our changes and end the reborrow of <code>m2</code>, or we can borrow multiple nodes at once if we want to (taking care not to borrow the same node twice), and nothing will be invalidated. Finally, at the end of scope we finally let the borrows <code>m1,m2,m3</code> end, and then drop <code>v1,v2,v3</code>.</p>\n<p>We don't need pinning here because we can't really do any damage by moving things (you can replace a node and its pointer but any incoming pointers will just point at the new data).

When you invalidate a node, you also kill all its children -- you prune that part of the tree.

As I see it, references already exist for asserting dereferenceability and validity where they are present. So raw pointers don't need to be particularly strong, as when applicable, pointers can be casted to references (or some composition of references and wrapper types) to make the properties known to the optimizing compiler. The requirement for the dereferenced addresses to be valid is unavoidable, but besides that, pointers can be quite lax in what properties they actually guarantee, and exist largely to ease address manipulations and make these operations more visible to the compiler for optimization. </p>\n<p>However, as you noted, the strength of the assertions that references can make doesn't entirely exist apart from pointers, and are influenced by what pointers can do.</p>",
