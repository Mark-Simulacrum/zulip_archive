If taking a pointer to element zero specifically only grants permission to access that element, not the rest of the allocation (which IIRC is what stacked borrows currently does) then accessing the rest of the array from that pointer is UB even if LLVM doesn't elide the rest of the array. (And conversely, of course, if we did allow it we'd have to make sure LLVM doesn't miscompile that!). Better use <code>.as_ptr()</code> on the slice to be sure! It's more readable anyway IMO.</p>",
