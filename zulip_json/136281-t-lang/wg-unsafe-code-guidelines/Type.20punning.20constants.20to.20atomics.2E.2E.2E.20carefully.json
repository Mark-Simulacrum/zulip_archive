This type is essentially always behind a pointer like <code>#[repr(transparent)] struct Outer(NonNull&lt;Inner&gt;);</code>.<br>\nThe tricky part is that I allow defining const instances of Inner/Outer by using</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"cp\">#[repr(C)]</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"k\">struct</span> <span class=\"nc\">StaticInner</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">is_static</span>: <span class=\"kt\">bool</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"c1\">// true iff defined as a static constant</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">count</span>: <span class=\"kt\">usize</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">payload</span>: <span class=\"nc\">Payload</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>That is, <code>StaticInner</code> is the same thing as <code>Inner</code> but <code>count</code> is a usize. All <code>StaticInner</code> instances have <code>is_static: true</code>, and all others have it false (in reality Inner and StaticInner are the same struct with different generic params to avoid getting out of sync). Then to define a the statics, I do this.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">const</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">SI</span>: <span class=\"kp\">&amp;</span><span class=\"nc\">StaticInner</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">&amp;</span><span class=\"n\">StaticInner</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">is_static</span>: <span class=\"nc\">true</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">count</span>: <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">payload</span>: <span class=\"o\">..</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">};</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"k\">const</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">EXAMPLE</span>: <span class=\"nc\">Outer</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">unsafe</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"n\">Outer</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">NonNull</span>::<span class=\"n\">new_unchecked</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">SI</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">as</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"k\">const</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">_</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">as</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"k\">mut</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Inner</span><span class=\"p\">))</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">};</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>So, this requires quite a bit of care to avoid UB, but I'm pretty sure I've managed it, but wanted to run it by y'all.</p>\n<p>(TLDR: if there's any chance the pointer I'm working with is to one of these type-punned StaticInners, I not only avoid touching <code>count</code> in any way at all, I avoid direct field access to any of the other fields, and instead use pointer arithmetic + memoffset::offset_of + casting. If i do have an <code>&amp;Inner</code>, it's only after verifying that it is not a <code>StaticInner</code>. Potentially worth noting that static or not, these values are fully immutable — that <code>count</code> is the mutability, interior or otherwise).</p>\n<p>Anyway, now, obviously it's UB if i were to write to a <code>Inner::count</code> where it was actually a type_punned <code>StaticInner</code>. Less obviously, it's still UB if I make a <code>&amp;AtomicUsize</code> without verifying that it's not a <code>StaticInner</code>. That means I can't read from <code>Inner::count</code>. It's also almost certainly UB if I were to ever view a non-static <code>Inner</code> as a <code>StaticInner</code>, but I have no need for this.</p>\n<p>More tricky, but also the reason I'm pretty confident it's fine, is that I never allow an <code>&amp;Inner</code> to exist without first verifying that it's not static. That means I only rarely use direct field access (the places where I do are always after I've verified <code>is_static</code> is <code>true</code>).</p>\n<p>So usually to get the payload i'll do <code>&amp;*ptr.cast::&lt;u8&gt;().add(offset_of!(Inner, payload)).cast::&lt;Payload&gt;()</code>, and to test <code>is_static</code> I'll do <code>*ptr.cast::&lt;u8&gt;().add(offset_of!(Inner, is_static)).cast::&lt;bool&gt;()</code> (FWIW I was worried that it wouldn't compile to a constant but it seems like it does on release at least).</p>\n<p>My paranoia in all of this is from the assumption that if I have a &amp;T, not only must it be valid, but all of its fields must be valid as well, and also the assumption that a <code>AtomicUsize</code> would be invalid if it actually lives in non-writable memory.</p>\n<p>So, given this, I can't really see how I'd be causing be UB here, since rust doesn't care what is actually behind a <code>*const Inner</code>, and all <code>&amp;T</code>s are fully of the type they claim. I did want to make sure I wasn't missing something though — My first pass at this actually used field accesses and while miri didn't mind, I'm pretty sure it was still UB.</p>",
