I had intended to post a list of possible topics a few days back but this week ran away from me. </p>\n<p>Update on last week's topics: <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"124287\">@mw</span> and I have been making some efforts to profile compiler etc, but ran into some challenges. I think it might make sense to find a few folks really interested in pursuing that. Preliminary measurements suggests that (a) parallel compilation is a win, (b) trait solving is a considerable source of time (~20-30%) for many benchmarks and involves solving the same tasks over and over (I would expect an ~95% hit rate for chalk-style caches). Future work that I would like to see is improving <code>-Zself-profile</code> and estimating impact of polymorphization (I'm working on that, hoping to collaborate with <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116107\">@davidtwco</span> more on it today), as well as possibly finding ways to get better measurements with perf (backtraces are a persistent challenge).</p>\n<p>For agenda, I was thinking we might take a slight turn from the technical and consider some of the following: please feel free to comment on which you think would be best.</p>\n<p>1. Triage and other meetings: how should we structure? Can we improve the current setup? What are its flaws, strengths?<br>\n2. Mentoring and bus factor: How can we help move people from \"working group participant\" into \"full-fledged team member\"? How can we reduce the \"bus factor\" for critical modules like type-checker, type resolver, etc?</p>",
