        "content": "<p>Hello!</p>\n<p>I was just wondering why rustc often makes broken ptx when targeting <code>nvptx64-nvidia-cuda</code>. Is this a case of rustc giving llvm wrong IR for ptx or the LLVM PTX backend just being broken? If it worked it would be wonderful to be able to write cuda kernels in rust. If this is a case of llvm being broken, couldnt there be a custom rustc backend that targets NVVM IR? the IR that NVCC uses, which is just a subset of LLVM IR</p>",
