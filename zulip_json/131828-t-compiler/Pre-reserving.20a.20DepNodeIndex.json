I am trying to extend the query system with push-based semantics: allow a query to opportunistically fill another query's cache. In order to correctly implement this, I need to have access to the current query's DepNodeIndex (ie. the query being executed). I can't find how to do that since you refactored the <code>DepGraph</code>. Do you have some pointers?</p>",
