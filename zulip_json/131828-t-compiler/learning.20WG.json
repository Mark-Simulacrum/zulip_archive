        "content": "<p>So I've been talking to <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116266\">@Santiago Pastorino</span> about the idea of creating a \"Learning WG\". I can think of a few others to cc here, but I'm sure I'm overlooking people: <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"218647\">@Amanjeev Sethi</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"209053\">@Iñaki Garay</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"217515\">@Federico Carrone</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"198054\">@mark-i-m</span>.</p>\n<p>I think the charter of this WG should be to make rustc easy to learn. This is perhaps too open-ended, so let me try to make it more specific:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To complete the rustc-guide to cover all major areas of rustc, perhaps with accompanying video content</li>\n<li>To ensure that rustc has API documentation on all of its internal structures</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I don't envision this being an overnight process, it's going to take some time, but I think it's one we can make steady progress on.  I am also open to narrowing down our focus -- probably to just the first item, since I have a clearer plan there.</p>\n<p>I have some concerns: primarily, I know my own time is way too finely sliced right now, so I would like to ensure that others are doing the organizational heavy lifting. I imagined that we would proceed by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creating a list of rustc-guide topics</li>\n<li>For each topic, doing a rustc lecture series video with some suitable person in rustc</li>\n<li>Creating a rustc-guide chapter from that video (and possibly follow-on videos and conversations)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This results in (a) a video and (b) a chapter.</p>\n<p>The plan for API docs would presumably be similar. We just try to work out way through.</p>\n<p>I imagine my own participation would be limited to helping to craft the topics and doing some of those videos. The remaining organizational work would have to be done by others. </p>\n<p>What do people think?</p>",
