The problem I face is that these two methods are the only one annotated with <code>feature = \"rustc_private\"</code>, so, If I remove them, rustc complains that it knows no such feature. </p>\n<p>I <em>think</em> I need to make <code>rustc_private</code> a language feature, as opposed to library features. I've tried to add it to <code>libsyntx/feature_gate</code>, as <code>(active, rustc_private, \"1.0.0\", None, None),</code>, but I still get \"error[E0635]: unknown feature <code>rustc_private</code>\". </p>\n<p>What should I do? :)</p>",
