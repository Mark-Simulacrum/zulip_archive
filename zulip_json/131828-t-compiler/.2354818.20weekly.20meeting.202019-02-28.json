We also discussed <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/tree/master/working-groups#membership\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/tree/master/working-groups#membership\">what it would mean to be a member of a working group</a>.</p>\n<p>We then went away and produced the working group template that other teams can base their directories in the repository on. Niko added some notes about creating new working groups and that process. Minimal definitions for the meta and async working groups were added. Niko then started kicking off some of the working groups in the <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"185694\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/185694-t-compiler.2Fwg-meta\">#t-compiler/wg-meta</a> channel.</p>\n</blockquote>",
