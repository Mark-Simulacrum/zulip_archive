Built on that I created <a href=\"https://travis-ci.org/rust-icci\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://travis-ci.org/rust-icci\">rust-icci</a>, a test suite of sample projects that verifies that incremental compilation yields correct code and doesn't crash. It has helped us a lot in the early development phases, catching bugs not covered by our test suite.</p>\n<p>However, it's also a maintenance burden (these are old code bases that need adaption in order to keep compiling with newer Rust versions) and apart from me, nobody is really looking at the results. Since incremental compilation is the default for debug and check builds these days, so I think it gets enough testing in the wild and <code>rust-icci</code> has outlived its usefulness.</p>\n<p>Does anybody have any objections to my turning it off?</p>",
