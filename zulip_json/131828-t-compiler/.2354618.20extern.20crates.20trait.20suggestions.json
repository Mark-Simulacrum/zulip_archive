The issue is that if a crate isn't loaded but has a <code>--extern</code> then it won't make a suggestion. So I figure when making suggestions I'd need to load any crates from <code>--extern</code>flags first so that it can make suggestions from all crates. That means that this is a fairly rare case, since you'd only ever run into it if you add a dependency and don't use it, but expect the suggestion from it in errors. Anyway, I'm not sure how I'd go about loading crates from <code>rustc_typeck</code>. If there was a way to access a <code>CrateLoader</code> I could probably call <code>maybe_process_path_extern</code> on the <code>session.extern_prelude</code> names.</p>",
