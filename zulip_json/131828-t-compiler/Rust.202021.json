If there's tracking issues or other related things, that's great. But even just incomplete ideas should go there so we don't forget to investigate them. Don't worry about structure/issue numbers/etc for now. Right now it's more like a brainstorm document where we're just collecting ideas to get a bit of an overview.</p>\n<p>Maybe something for the agenda of the next meeting?</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p>(Please put any discussion of 2021 changes to <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"268952\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/268952-edition\">#edition</a>! Thanks!)</p>",
