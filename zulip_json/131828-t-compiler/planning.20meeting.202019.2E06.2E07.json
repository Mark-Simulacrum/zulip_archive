Would it not be more efficient for someone to asynchronously ping the relevant people every 2 weeks asking what they want to discuss (if anything) and how important it is (i.e. what it is blocking) and any relevant background info (or perhaps even have a google form that feeds a spreadsheet of possible discussion topics)? Then at the time of the meeting, just pick the top thing on the priority queue and discuss it? It just seems like a lot of these process things have fallen to pnkfelix and niko recently, and they already seem oversubscribed (though perhaps that's just my perception).</p>",
