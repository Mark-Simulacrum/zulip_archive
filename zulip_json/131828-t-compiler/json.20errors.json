The idea is to make people aware when a dependency will fail to compile in the future. Cargo collects those warnings from rustc and displays a small summary that can be expanded.  Does Buck also use <code>--cap-lints=allow</code> for dependencies?  If other build systems use cap-lints, I'm wondering if it makes sense to unconditionally show those warnings, or if it should be opt-in.</p>",
