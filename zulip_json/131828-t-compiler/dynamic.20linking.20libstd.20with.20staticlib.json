To support dynamically linking there will need to be some way to prevent rustc from bundling it and to emit information to the build system about which dylibs need to be linked in.</p>",

My understanding is that the templated parts are compiled into the binary (as they exist in headers), and the rest is just normal dynamic linking? I think rust works the same way where \"generics ~= templates\", but I'd be interested in a compiler person could confirm! In that case, I'd be interested to keep up with the PR and see how much binary size is saved with dynamic linking of the stdlib</p>",
