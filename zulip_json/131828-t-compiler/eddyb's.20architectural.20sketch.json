I'd love to discuss high-level architecture at some point. The thing I am struggling most with are spans: as far as I understand, the are pretty much ingrained into almost every rustc data structure, but in ra I doesn't have them: they make incremental hard, and they are lossy in a sense that it's hard to get from IR back to the syntax tree using spans (you can' but that feels not type-safe). That is, for IDE the arrows should be bidirectional, and, while spans can play some role in the inverse transform, I am not sure it's the right approach.</p>",
