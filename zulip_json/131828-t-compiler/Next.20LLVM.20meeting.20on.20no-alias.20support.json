The next one will be on <strong>July the 14th</strong>.</p>\n<p>I'm posting this here for if anyone wants to chip in / represent rustc's perspective / just learn from it. I don't think I can really give them much of my own harvest, but I might go to learn from it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ybwEKDVtIbhIhK50qYtwKsL50K-NvB6LfuBsfepBZ9Y/edit#heading=h.vpxs8lkuxy79\">This</a> is the google document they are using to organize (you can see the past meetings' notes down below).</p>\n<p>I hope this is useful to some of y'all <span aria-label=\"heart\" class=\"emoji emoji-2764\" role=\"img\" title=\"heart\">:heart:</span></p>",
