I made a mistake an added a semicolon after a function call inside an unsafe block (as in <a href=\"https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=c77daa3cc023d02f8b7353a581ffe527\">https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=c77daa3cc023d02f8b7353a581ffe527</a>). Do you think that there is a way to modify rustc to return a more meaningful message? I am willing to work on the fix, if this could be relevant.</p>",
