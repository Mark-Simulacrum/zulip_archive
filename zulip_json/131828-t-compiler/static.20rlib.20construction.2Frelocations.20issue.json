        "content": "<p>Hi.  I'm seeing an issue with the Rust toolchain build on an illumos system.  The rough gist is: the LLVM archives (*.a) seem to get build correctly (with -fPIC) such that they will work in the subsequent librustc_llvm shared library.  But, whatever process it is that takes those *.a and turns them into an *.rlib seems to alter the program text in a way that is confusing our linker.  The resultant binary seems to have some R_X86_64_PC32 relocations left in what need to be read-only text sections.</p>\n<p>Is there some information on how \"rustc-link-lib=static=...\" works, with particular respect to transformation of the input objects, somewhere?  Or should I just read through the compiler source some more?</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
