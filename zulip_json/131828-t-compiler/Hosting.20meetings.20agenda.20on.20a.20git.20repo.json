Rarely happened but a lack of sync with their servers had me lose some content.</p>\n<p>My suggestion is the following workflow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a subdir on <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/\">https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/</a> (or any other repo under <code>rust-lang</code> that someone from <span class=\"user-group-mention silent\" data-user-group-id=\"2403\">WG-prioritization</span> can have write perms) and push there all the past meetings agenda</li>\n<li>Every week add a new document generated by our trusted triagebot</li>\n<li>Offline edit the agenda with everyone's preferred tool</li>\n<li>Paste the finalized .md document on HackMD for everyone to see during the meeting</li>\n<li>(further edits and refinements during or after the meeting are manually synced back to the git repo)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Opinions?</p>",
