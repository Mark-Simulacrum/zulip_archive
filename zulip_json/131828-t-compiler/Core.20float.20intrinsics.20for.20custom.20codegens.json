        "content": "<p>Hello!<br>\nI am currently working on a custom codegen that targets CUDA, CUDA has special libdevice intrinsics for float things, but i was wondering, why does core or build-std not have an option to expose float intrinsics that are usually only in std if the backend can generate the intrinsics? I can generate the intrinsics like powf_32 just fine, but core does not expose them (because it doesnt want to rely on libm i presume). It would be great if i could tell build-std to just expose those intrinsics because the codegen is able to generate them, maybe like `-Z build-std-features=float-intrinsics</p>",
