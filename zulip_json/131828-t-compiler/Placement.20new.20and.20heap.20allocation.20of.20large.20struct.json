Gary's proposal is pretty much the same, except this time it pulls RVO into equation to help with the problem of function call expressions. And wraps the previously inline arbitrary RHS into a function call through a <code>FnOnce</code>. RVO and the function call cancel each other and you still end up with a place and an arbitrary RHS. </p>\n<p>The reason C++ is able to guarantee in-place construction is because they pass the <code>this</code> pointers/places all the way down their constructor stack and the constructor code generally is written to boil down to the most basic assignment statements to fields on said place. In the instances where the assignments are not trivial, you must use placement-new (<code>new (place) Something { ... }</code>) in the smaller constructors to retain the guarantee all the way down.
