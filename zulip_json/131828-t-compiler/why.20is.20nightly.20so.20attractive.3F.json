Basically <em>select</em> things that are \"close to ready\" can be stretched down to being in Beta as well as Nightly. This lets us expand the tester base potentially quite a bit and hopefully finish out any last minute problems that do cone up. It also lets people in the ecosystem know that new things are in the pipeline. For example, I think relatively few people were aware that min_const_generics were happening ahead of the Stable release. Outside of the rust project itself most people are far less \"terminally-online\".</p>",
