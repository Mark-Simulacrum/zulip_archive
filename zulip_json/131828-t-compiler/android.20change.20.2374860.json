They outline that it is somewhat of a breaking change for certain constructs, such as <code>File::from_raw_fd(22).into_raw_fd()</code>. I'm inclined to land it with the relnotes tag, but I'm not sure the proper process here. (It'd be nice if we had a notification group for the android target  I suppose)</p>",
