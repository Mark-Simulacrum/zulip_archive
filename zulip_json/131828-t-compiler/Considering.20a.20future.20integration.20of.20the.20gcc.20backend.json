It's not the amount of code that's the problem; it's that it can't be added anywhere without touching cg_llvm <em>and</em> cg_clif <em>and</em> miri <em>and</em> cg_gcc.</p>\n<p>If the first step for a new intrinsic was just \"add it as just the <code>core::intrinsics</code> signature, with the MIR fallback\" then that can be done independently, with all the specific backends choosing whether they need something custom separately -- at least one certainly would, but that makes it become a separable concern.</p>\n<p>(And having the MIR implementation, where possible, would be nice for the specification.  And we tend to write suboptimal rust implementations of new things -- at least for easy things like <code>cttz_nonzero</code> anyway -- as part of bootstrapping, so just keeping those around wouldn't be much extra work.)</p>\n<p>I think it'll be great to have the GCC backend.
