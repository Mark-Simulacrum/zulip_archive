Our goal is:<br>\n     + <code>./x.py fmt</code> will format everything in the repo according to our wants.<br>\n     + <code>./x.py test src/tools/tidy</code> + CI will enforce formatting.<br>\n     + <code>@bors fmt</code> will add a commit to the PR where <code>./x.py fmt</code> has been executed.</p>\n<p>2. Rollout plan:<br>\n     a. We will start by encoding the formatting rules into <code>tidy</code>.<br>\n     b. <code>tidy</code> will only require formatting inside directories with a <code>.enforcefmt</code> file.<br>\n     c. We will incrementally start adding <code>.enforcefmt</code> files to higher and higher level folders until there's just one top-level <code>.enforcefmt</code> file.<br>\n     d. We remove the <code>.enforcefmt</code>  file and <code>tidy</code> now enforces it globally everywhere (possible caveat around submodules).</p>\n<p>What do you think? Also, what is the best avenue for discuss the draft before publishing the RFC to rust-lang/rfcs?</p>",
