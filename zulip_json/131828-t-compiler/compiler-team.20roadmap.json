To start, I wanted to get an idea of <em>what we are we actually doing right now</em>, or what have we started doing but never completed -- I've created a <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/3ES5_GhwTzOVmPS8AuaVvw\" title=\"https://hackmd.io/3ES5_GhwTzOVmPS8AuaVvw\">hackmd</a> and started jotting down all the things I can think of.  Please add things I'm missing!</p>",
