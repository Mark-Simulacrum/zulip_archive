Do you want to see the feature in more crates of the standard library? And if so, shall I continue to do it by hand, or would it be better to wait until there is a machine-applicable suggestion for adding the <code>unsafe</code> blocks automatically? Should I open an MCP for that?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance for your answers <span aria-label=\"big smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f604\" role=\"img\" title=\"big smile\">:big_smile:</span></p>",
