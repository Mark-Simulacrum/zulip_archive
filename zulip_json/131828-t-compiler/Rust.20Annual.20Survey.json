As I mentioned on Friday, we are currently working on the 2021 Rust Survey, and we would love your feedback on what you would like to learn from the survey. To that end, I've created <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@ryanlevick/rJFqnDV6O\">a document</a> that outlines the \"high-level\" questions, we'd love to get answers to from survey data. This document is not meant as a place to discuss the survey question themselves but rather the questions we hope the survey data will help us answer. <strong>Please feel free to give it a read and leave any comments on what to add, remove, or improve.</strong> <br>\nIf you would like to participate in the effort, stop by <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"294169\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/294169-t-community.2Frust-survey-2021\">#t-community/rust-survey-2021</a></p>",
