I'd like to explore why the <a href=\"https://github.com/lark-exploration/lark\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/lark-exploration/lark\">https://github.com/lark-exploration/lark</a> crates seem to take so much more time to recompile than I would expect. They are using salsa, so they have the property that they push a lot of the code into the final crate where the full \"database type\" is known, so my theory is that something about our partitioning or CGU scheme winds up forcing us to rebuild a lot more than you might expect.</p>",
