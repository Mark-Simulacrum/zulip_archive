It is only necessary when you actually want to use the vendor intrinsics of the respective arch. <code>core</code> shouldn't need any changes either as the only arch dependent things in there are workarounds for LLVM bugs I think. You only need to enable the LLVM target and add a target specification to compiler/rustc_target I think. In addition you may want to add support to various widely used crates that are arch dependent like libc and cc.</p>",
