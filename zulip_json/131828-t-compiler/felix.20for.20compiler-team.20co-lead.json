Felix was a \"founding member\" of the compiler team when it first started, and was involved with Rust long before that. For the last year or so, he's been taking over an increasingly large share of \"compiler team leadership\", including running the weekly triage meeting and generally tending to the quality of the compiler as a whole. So many thanks to <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"116083\">pnkfelix</span> for all that he does, and congratulations! <span aria-label=\"tada\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f389\" role=\"img\" title=\"tada\">:tada:</span> </p>\n</blockquote>",
