That is, you have types like “crate”, “module”, “function», etc. module has parent, children, functions method which return apropriate objects. All objects look as if they are fully compiled: all references are resolved, all types are infered, etc.</p>\n<p>This model will be convenient to use on the ide (and probably rustdoc) side to use. It will also give us an enormose amount of flexibility, if the “implementation” of the model is swappable. I see at least two long term back ends for OO code model.</p>\n<p>The first one is lazy on demand query based backend (although the model looks like as if everything is computed, it certainly can just kick queries when methods are called).</p>\n<p>The second one is backed by a data file. That is, a model which reads something like save analysis, where method calls deserialize various bits of data.</p>\n<p>And, of course, in the meantime rust-analyzer can also produce such a model :-)</p>",
