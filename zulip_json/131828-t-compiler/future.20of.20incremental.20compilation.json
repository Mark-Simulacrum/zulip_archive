Using side-effects, typechecking could just declare that one constant has such type based on the const parameter it replaces, and compilation could go on with it.<br>\nThere are some examples of queries which perform a bunch of computations together, just for other queries to unbundle the results. This happens for lifetime resolution for instance. Meanwhile, some other queries are tightly coupled because they work on the same data (type parameter &amp; predicate collection?).<br>\nOne other difficulty is that the information flow is <em>really</em> difficult to understand.

    {
        "content": "<p>Some thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I think the query system as implemented right now is not in good shape. It is incredibly hard to understand what's going on internally (even though its basically just a system that allows for caching the results of functions). Some of that is due to parallel support, some of it is just because it has grown over the years without a major trim-down and gone through many performance optimizations that regressed readability. It probably could be moved to a completely external library like Salsa.</li>\n<li>I think one of main problems of the current system is that the abstractions are so leaky. Everything still has access to what is in Session and there are many other things in the tcx that should really only be accessible as a query. And types like Span and DefId, which are constructed before the query system kicks in, just don't fit the model -- these are things that probably would never have shown up as an issue for something that was written atop of e.g. Salsa from the start.</li>\n<li>I think query-based / pull-based architectures have a lot going for them. They force you to make data dependencies explicit. One can read a query provider and look at what other queries it calls until one reaches the inputs. Having a common kind of API, as <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"310518\">@Jake</span> mentions is a big plus. A query-based architecture also makes it \"easy enough\" to synchronize parallel evaluation of things because all computations are explicitly structured into a DAG. And you can only partially compile a crate, as <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"239881\">@Josh Triplett</span> mentions.</li>\n<li>Pull-based architectures also have their downsides. One kind of has to think about everything backwards. And it is hard to know when resources are not needed anymore and thus can be dropped.</li>\n<li>IIRC, at the time when the query system was adopted, it was still the plan to have rustc be an LSP server. So there was no real alternative to having a fine-grained on-demand system. I don't think this a requirement anymore.</li>\n<li>A pass-based architecture sounds appealing if it can be kept simple. There is a risk though, that it would end up as a complex mix of forward passes and ad-hoc on-demand evaluation, just without a clear governing structure, like a query system (in theory) can provide.</li>\n<li>It would really be awesome if one could view the compiler as a series of passes, each with a clear inputs and outputs.</li>\n<li>Independently of pass-based or on-demand, dealing with incremental compilation introduces a strong requirement for producing deterministic and \"stable\" intermediate artifacts and being able to match values between compilation sessions. One still has to know if something from an on-disk cache can be re-used or not. Getting rid of queries would not solve things like DefId drift. On the other hand, there might be simpler ways of keeping things stable. </li>\n<li>I suspect that doing any kind of interning of complex values actually introduces some of the same constraints that we have for incr. comp. at the moment, like <code>Eq</code> not ignoring parts of the interned value. The current incr. comp. system however makes it much more likely that a failure of upholding these constraints turns into an ICE.</li>\n<li>For a pass-based approach that supports parallelism one will likely want to write most data transformations as side-effect-free functions that don't access global state. A which point you are pretty close to a query system :)</li>\n<li>Many of the current system's problems stem from dependency tracking, not from being on-demand, I think. A pass-based approach that also tries to do dependency tracking would have to solve the same problems.</li>\n<li>Many of our current problems also stem from refactoring the compiler in-place. That would also be a problem for any other kind of global refactoring.</li>\n</ul>",

However, I imagine the hybrids as follows:<br>\n- push-based + registration model: each query would be invoked in two ways:<br>\n   compute which calls the backing function and stores its result, and get which recovers the result but does not compute it.<br>\n   Calling compute in the right order would be the responsibility of an orchestrator. A query would not be allowed to call compute, only the orchestrator can. This can be enshrined into types, having a OrchestrationCtxtand a DataCtxt in place of the TyCtxt. When compute is called, the dependency graph is probed to see if the node is green. If it is and the value can be recovered from disk, the computation is skipped.<br>\n   Calling get is only allowed from queries. When the data has not been computed yet, get would return None. Dependency handling would happen in calls to get, like it does now. We could add the possibility for a query to push a result into another one as a side effect, with a specific marker for dependency handling (this allows to handle cycles).<br>\n- pull-based + forward declaration: each query would list all of its dependencies in a separate function, and the actual query code would ICE if it accesses information outside of this list. (There may be a better way to do this, for instance to have compile-time checks, but I haven't tought of it yet.) As the list of dependencies is known in advance, the query system can walk the dependency graph, and detect cycles before calling any computation. This would allow to have dedicated code to handle the cycle.</p>\n</blockquote>",
