I'm really happy to say that we finally started double-gating CI on both Azure Pipelines and GitHub Actions! <span aria-label=\"tada\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f389\" role=\"img\" title=\"tada\">:tada:</span> <span aria-label=\"tada\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f389\" role=\"img\" title=\"tada\">:tada:</span> <span aria-label=\"tada\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f389\" role=\"img\" title=\"tada\">:tada:</span> </p>\n<p><strong>What does this mean?</strong><br>\nThis is the last step before fully migrating to GitHub Actions: bors will now require <em>both</em> Azure Pipelines and GitHub Actions for a PR to be tried or merged. The practical impact is that build failures will be reported faster (as GitHub Actions will fail before Azure Pipelines), while green builds will still be slow (as we need to wait for Azure Pipelines).</p>\n<p><strong>Why is the double-gate needed?</strong><br>\nThe double gate allows us to spot the last issues with the GitHub Actions configuration while still making sure we're not landing bad code (as Azure Pipelines is still running).</p>\n<p><strong>What if I notice a spurious failure?</strong><br>\nIf you notice any issue due to GitHub Actions please ping the infrastructure team.</p>",
