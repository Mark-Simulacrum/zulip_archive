Unfortunately, it turns out they're all adding <em>different</em> flags, in such a way I don't know whether it's unintentional or not. Here is a sample: <a href=\"https://www.toptal.com/developers/hastebin/evasofudec.rust\">https://www.toptal.com/developers/hastebin/evasofudec.rust</a></p>\n<p>Should I take the union of all the flags? Leave out <code>RUSTFLAGS</code> for some of the tests because it changes the behavior? Just leave it all as is? not sure ...</p>",
