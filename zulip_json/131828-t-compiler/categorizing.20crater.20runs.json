I would say that executing on the plan above would already be a big help, and if anyone needs more ideas, the usual next step for the crater runs is reproducing and minimizing those regressions. That is also a harder task to automate but I've often had success with <a href=\"https://github.com/jethrogb/rust-reduce/\">https://github.com/jethrogb/rust-reduce/</a> sometimes combined with c-reduce, all in all just removing a lot of unneeded code, even if the result is not the most minimal is already a great help</p>",
