I don't want the object file to contain any relocation entries like <code>R_X86_64_GOTPC64</code>, <code>R_X86_64_GOT64</code>, <code>R_X86_64_GOTOFF64</code>. <br>\nI just upgraded to rustc 1.32.0 and it now uses the <code>.got</code> no matter what I do.  Disabling pic, pie, or plt don't seem to be doing the trick. Any tips? </p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
