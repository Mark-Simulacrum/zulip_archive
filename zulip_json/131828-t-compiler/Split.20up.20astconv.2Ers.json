        "content": "<p>Hi people, I recently started working on <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/67418\">this issue</a> and am encountering a bit of an issue. The trait <code>AstConv</code> has an <code>impl dyn trait</code> that spans over 3000 lines. I'm unsure as to how to split them into one super trait and a few subtraits. Would it be much of a breaking change ? It does not seem to have too much impact, only in some places of the compiler. However, it would break some of the encapsulation introduced by the use of an <code>impl dyn trait</code>.</p>",
