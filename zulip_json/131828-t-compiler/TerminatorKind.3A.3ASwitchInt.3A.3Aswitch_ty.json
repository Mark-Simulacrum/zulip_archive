That's always suspicious (at least there should be a consistency check), but its only use in codegen is when <code>targets.len() == 2</code>, which also seems odd. Really the <code>discr</code> type should suffice for basically everything.</p>\n<p>However, in trying to remove this field I stumbled over <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/7adbc0dfeffcb6c2ae489cc97d28f76612c7cdf3/src/librustc_middle/mir/mod.rs#L1697\">this use</a> that I cannot find a way to remove. It seems odd to have a field just for pretty-printing though. Any advice/ideas?</p>",

Maybe we should revamp mir pretty printing to use a scheme like type pretty printing instead of doing weird things with <code>Debug</code></p>",
