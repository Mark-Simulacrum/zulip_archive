Is there a reason that the diagnostics are collected and then emitted all at once instead of emitting them as they are encountered?  I'm thinking it would simplify the JSON interface to just emit a normal diagnostic structure that has an extra field with the future-incompat status.  This could also make it safer to enable it for non-cargo users.</p>",

They will only need to add a new field to the existing Diagnostic struct. If the tool doesn't know about that new field, it will just treat it like a normal warning. If it is a new top-level structure, tools may ignore it (or worse, choke on it). </p>\n<p>It is not an important change, but just an idea to simplify a little.</p>",
