I'm going to pull out some of the things I feel most pressing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Project management -- can we make this an explicit role in compiler team? Can we talk about how we've structed things to make it smoother to run meetings, take notes, etc? (nikomatsakis)</li>\n<li>Roadmap review -- in particular, do we have enough focus on shorter term compilation time gains? (nikomatsakis)<br>\n    - related specific idea: <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/58465\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/58465\">Pipelined rustc compilation</a> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>there are a bunch of other things I'd love to talk about in that document, though, so take a look. I pulled out the Project Management question because I think getting a better handle on <em>that</em> side of things (our organizational side) would help us achieve all the other things.</p>",

Among other things, I suspect there is still low-hanging fruit to be picked, but also I'm not convinced we have a good picture of what consumes the time when compiling (and it might not even be in the compiler). I'd like us to be able to say \"not only are we working on RLS 2.0, but we've made serde 5% faster\" (or whatever). Discuss. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Needs of the compiler team:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Can we try to enumerate what are some of things the compiler team needs to be tracking? What communication is (or <em>should</em>) be happening? I'd like us to be able to come up with a good list of all the things we think <em>should</em> be happening, so that we can compare against our existing processes, and try to ensure they are covered (or adjust the processes as needed).</p>",
