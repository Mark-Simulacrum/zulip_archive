I'm curious to push a bit on this approach that I had been advocating for early on and I'm wondering if either of you have interest in exploring that.</p>",

The key idea there was to (a) identify type variables that that got their value as a result of diverging fallback and then (b) warn when we find those type variables in \"certain contexts\". The challenge is narrowing down that notion of \"certain contexts\". </p>\n<p>The current branch was just warning whenever the type of <strong>any expression</strong> is changed as a result of \"diverging fallback\". That's clearly not correct. I think what we conceptually want is to warn whenever the type of a <strong>live</strong> expression is changed as the result of diverging fallback. That raises, of course, the question of how to determine where the \"live\" expressions are.</p>",
