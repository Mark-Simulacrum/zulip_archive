The TL;DR is</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you need a PR</li>\n<li>rfcbot fcp merge is required from compiler team</li>\n<li>you need a proposal </li>\n</ul>\n<p>I described writing the proposal as an MCP. Plausibly it could be linked on the PR thread instead, as we've sometimes done, but I thought it'd be better to keep \"Design discussion = MCP\". I'm open to changing this, as it does have the downside (or benefit, from your POV) of splitting conversation off from the implementation PR. (I see that as sort of good, since it can separate things like nits about the code, CI failures, or merge conflicts from the design question.)</p>\n<p>One question that I don't know is: where should the rfcbot fcp merge take place? On the MCP? On the PR? Who cares? I think I wrote on the MCP. I don't really care as long as it happens somewhere. =)</p>",
