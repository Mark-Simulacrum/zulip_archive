Is this a '<code>gcx</code>/<code>'tcx</code> leftover thing? I was thinking it would be a good idea to make <code>Lift</code> use the interners instead of <code>in_arena</code> so we don't need to add efficient arenas with <code>in_arena</code>. I think <code>Lift</code> is pretty much only used for <code>Debug</code> and <code>Display</code> impls in the compiler now.Lift in Chalk interface</p>",
