The most prominent one is a 25% slowdown on a style benchmark (for stylo, one of our rust components). One of our devs, dmajor, tracked this down to a codegen issue for a specific function where before xLTO a 7-byte <code>nop</code> instruction was used to 16-byte align the following instruction. With xLTO enabled it appears to be generating 7 x 1-byte<code>nop</code> instructions instead. We were wondering if someone from the compiler team could help us look into this further (perhaps someone knows where this logic exists, at what point in compilation this happens, etc). Any help or pointers on who to talk to would be really great! If the answer is just mw, then we can wait, but it would be nice to get a head start!</p>",
