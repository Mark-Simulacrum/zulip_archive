        "content": "<p>Currently, the validation of some attributes is spread across two parts of the code: the <code>check_attrs</code> pass and the <code>codegen_fn_attrs</code> query. To me there is no clear principle behind what kind of check goes where. Besides being inelegant, this split causes bugs: some errors are only emitted if <code>codegen_fn_attrs</code> is called on the function/method/closure that has an invalid attribute, and <code>check_attrs</code> tries to call it for that purpose but it's rather incomplete and the condition for this can get out of sync with other conditions for where attributes are permitted. So sometimes some validation is only performed during codegen. This leads to bugs such as <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/70307\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/70307\">#70307</a> and mysterious test failures (now resolved) in <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/69274\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/69274\">#69274</a>.</p>\n<p>I feel like there should be a more robust and unified way to perform attribute validation, but I'm not sure what it looks like and would appreciate ideas. Some of the \"validation\" in <code>codegen_fn_attrs</code> is clearly appropriate there (in particular, the parsing of the values passed to attributes), but I don't see a principled way to ensure it runs <em>before</em> codegen on <em>every</em> item and expression. OTOH, we can't really move the \"does this attribute even make sense on this kind of item/expression\" checks out of <code>check_attrs</code> because <code>codegen_fn_attrs</code> only applies to function-like things.</p>",
