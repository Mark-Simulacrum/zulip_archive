I'm hoping that many of you would like to join for the <a href=\"https://rust-code-reading-club.github.io/rustc/meetings/2021-11-04.html\">first meeting</a>! We had made a <a href=\"https://rust-code-reading-club.github.io/rustc/\">little website here</a>.</p>\n<p>The goal here is both to offer new contributors a friendly way to learn more about rustc but also to help those of us who already know rustc to learn more of it (I also think it's nice for people to see that even experienced compiler hackers get confused sometimes reading the code). To that end, I picked a bit of code to read for the first few meetings that <em>I personally</em> would like to know better -- the name resolution code (cc <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"123856\">@Vadim Petrochenkov</span>!). Would love to get suggestions for future meetings.</p>\n<p>It occurs to me though, how would people feel about making this an \"official\" compiler team activity? We could make a little subteam (<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"394977\">@Doc Jones</span> and I would be happy to lead for now) and move the repo into rust-lang; we'd also create a <code>t-compiler/code-reading-club</code> stream.  Both of us would definitely prefer it that way! I'll bring it up in the triage meeting today.</p>",
