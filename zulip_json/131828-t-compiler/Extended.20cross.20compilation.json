The extended build fails for interesting reasons: the build starts from a x86_64 rustc run through rosetta 2, and builds a x86_64 extended stage 1, which fails building cargo because there is no x86_64 libssl on the system. The only libssl I have is from homebrew, and it's arm64 native. And homebrew apparently dropped support for universal binaries... I tried switching to build openssl statically in config.toml, but that failed too (but I don't remember what the error was)<br>\nAnyways, I actually wonder why the build system wants to build an intermediate x86_64 cargo, when what is actually wanted is an arm64 one.</p>",
