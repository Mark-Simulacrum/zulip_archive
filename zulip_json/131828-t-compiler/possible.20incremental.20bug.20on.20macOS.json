I initially removed the cache upon suggestion from another user, but now that it's re-arisen, I believe this to be a compiler bug. It appears as if this only occurs on macOS; I run Linux, so I'm unable to reproduce this manually.</p>\n<p>You can see an example failure in the \"Test (stable, macOs-latest)\" section here: <a href=\"https://github.com/time-rs/time/runs/1052989207?check_suite_focus=true\">https://github.com/time-rs/time/runs/1052989207?check_suite_focus=true</a><br>\nIgnore the other failures, as those are wholly unrelated.
