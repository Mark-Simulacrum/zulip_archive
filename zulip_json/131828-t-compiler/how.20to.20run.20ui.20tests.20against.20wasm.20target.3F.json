        "content": "<p>Hi guys, not sure if this is the right group but Oli recommended that I ask a question on the compiler channel. Does anyone know how to manually run the ui tests against a wasm target build? This is the only documentation I have been able to find about it: <a href=\"https://rust-lang.github.io/rustc-guide/tests/intro.html#testing-on-emulators\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://rust-lang.github.io/rustc-guide/tests/intro.html#testing-on-emulators\">https://rust-lang.github.io/rustc-guide/tests/intro.html?#testing-on-emulators</a>.</p>\n<p>I am asking because some new unit tests I added are breaking the tests that run against this target on azure. The tests break because I am using async and I was using compiler flags instead of setting the edition:2018 in the test. At least I believe that this is the issue but I cannot confirm it until I can run those tests manually.</p>",
