        "content": "<p>TLDR: I'm wondering if we should keep the \"lazy constant pattern\" approach around, which ensures that we don't expand a <code>const FOO: &amp;[u8] = include_bytes!(super_large_file);</code> if used in a pattern. It has a significant cost to keep around, but saves some compile time for large constants.</p>\n<p>While working on <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70699\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70699\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70699</a> I've tried to analyze our entire setup for how constants are used in patterns. We have a very whacky scheme that I've just bolted on more parts over the years. I think we should implement a really thought through scheme once and for all instead of playing whack-a-mole with ICEs and weird \"unreachable pattern\" bugs. Right now we have both <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_mir_build/hair/pattern/const_to_pat.rs#L20\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_mir_build/hair/pattern/const_to_pat.rs#L20\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_mir_build/hair/pattern/const_to_pat.rs#L20</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_mir_build/hair/pattern/_match.rs#L260\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_mir_build/hair/pattern/_match.rs#L260\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_mir_build/hair/pattern/_match.rs#L260</a> which expand different parts of constants to patterns. Amusingly nowadays both of these are just invoked from <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_mir_build/hair/pattern/check_match.rs#L136\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_mir_build/hair/pattern/check_match.rs#L136\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_mir_build/hair/pattern/check_match.rs#L136</a> right after each other, so merging them will strictly be an improvement.</p>\n<p>But even beyond that, we don't actually expand all constants fully into their components. There is/was a worry that if we expanded a <code>const FOO: &amp;[u8] = include_bytes!(some_huge_file);</code> that compilation would get very slow (as we'd create a slice pattern with one sub-pattern per byte in that file. As const eval gets more powerful, other, similarly large constants may exist. Out of that reason we have a lazy way to expand constants only when needed, but that is a rather buggy scheme (whether a const pattern comes before or after a slice pattern makes compilation behave differently) that I don't really grok (as in I understand all parts of it but I have never managed to hold the entire thing in my head at once).</p>\n<p>So... one way to go forward would be to just expand all constants to their component patterns. This would be the easiest way, as we have all the support for user-written patterns already existing. It would be a nicely modular way to keep handling of constants out of the pattern match code.<br>\nThis also gets very problematic in the presence of slices of zsts, as the user can specify a constant with a repeat expression, which creates a very small constant, but expanding it to a full slice pattern gives us a sub-pattern per slice element.</p>\n<p>If we want to keep a lazy scheme, everything becomes a bit more complex. The problem is our exhaustiveness checks. The exhaustiveness checks need to look at all fields. Right now they do this in the hybrid system where some things are expanded and some are not. This is also where the ordering problem comes from. If a constant is used before a slice pattern, the constant did not get expanded and was treated as a single unknown value. So even if a following slice pattern had the exact same value as the constant, we treated it as separate and did not emit an unreachable pattern lint. If the constant comes after, we already know that we are looking at slice patterns of certain lengths and check the constant against that. If we want to fix these things correctly, we'll need to fetch the length of const slice patterns without looking at their elements. The current implementation treats constants as non-aggregate (<a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/548afdbe1a600ba868ac00acc4e94cca0242b001/src/librustc_mir_build/hair/pattern/_match.rs#L956\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/548afdbe1a600ba868ac00acc4e94cca0242b001/src/librustc_mir_build/hair/pattern/_match.rs#L956\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/548afdbe1a600ba868ac00acc4e94cca0242b001/src/librustc_mir_build/hair/pattern/_match.rs#L956</a>).</p>\n<p>So my question is whether I should put in work into fixing the lazy const scheme we have or make it dead code by expanding all constants into their smallest components and then removing it.</p>",
