It's sparse at the moment but online, at <a href=\"https://rust-lang.github.io/polonius/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://rust-lang.github.io/polonius/\">https://rust-lang.github.io/polonius/</a>, and more documentation work is in-flight and planned.<br>\n- the exploration and prototype on the rules offering more flow-sensitive precision for the analysis has also progressed a lot.<br>\n- also did some refactoring, and work quite a bit on performance. And since the latter can step on the other work and vice-versa, we decided to focus on completeness first, and then after that has been achieved, re-adapt and land the optimization work.</p>\n<p>Some more news:<br>\n. - Niko has done a presentation on Polonius at RustBelt Rust. Slides are available at <a href=\"https://nikomatsakis.github.io/rust-belt-rust-2019/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://nikomatsakis.github.io/rust-belt-rust-2019/\">https://nikomatsakis.github.io/rust-belt-rust-2019/</a><br>\n- Albin has finished their master's thesis, and is currently rewriting most of the draft (which was available at <a href=\"user_uploads/4715/ufu5BGNrkzVbV8FtkK3Tco6M/Albins-Thesis-draft-version.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"user_uploads/4715/ufu5BGNrkzVbV8FtkK3Tco6M/Albins-Thesis-draft-version.pdf\">https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/user_uploads/4715/ufu5BGNrkzVbV8FtkK3Tco6M/Albins-Thesis-draft-version.pdf</a>).<br>\n- we hope to have a \"polonius work week\" at the end of November to push the in-progress work over the finish line together.</p>\n</blockquote>",
