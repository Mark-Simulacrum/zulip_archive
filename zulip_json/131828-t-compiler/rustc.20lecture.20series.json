I was thinking it'd be great to try and do a recording about some part of the compiler. I had even discussed with <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"209053\">@Iñaki Garay</span> the idea of starting an effort to take these recordings and convert them into rustc-guide chapters.</p>\n<p>With that in my mind, here were a few ideas I had for things to talk about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>HIR<br>\n    - Covering the role of HIR, how the HIR lowering code works<br>\n    - Candidates: me, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"127859\">@Taylor Cramer</span>, perhaps <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"119009\">@eddyb</span>?</li>\n<li>The <code>ty</code> module -- how it works<br>\n    - The arenas, the <code>'tcx</code> and <code>'gcx</code> lifetimes<br>\n    - The <code>TypeFoldable</code> trait and the <code>TyRelate</code> trait<br>\n    - Maybe covering the basics of type inference<br>\n    - Candidates: me, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"121053\">@varkor</span>, perhaps <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"119009\">@eddyb</span>?</li>\n<li>Typeck Tables and the type checker<br>\n    - Covering how the type checker works at a high-level and the role of the typeck tables</li>\n<li>HAIR, the MIR, and MIR construction<br>\n    - Covering the definition of MIR<br>\n    - Covering the HAIR construction<br>\n    - Covering MIR building<br>\n    - (This is actively changing as part of <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"189540\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/189540-t-compiler.2Fwg-mir-opt\">#t-compiler/wg-mir-opt</a>, so that's a downside, but otoh maybe the coverage of MIR building would be helpful for <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116266\">@Santiago Pastorino</span>)<br>\n    - Candidates: me, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"124288\">@oli</span>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"119009\">@eddyb</span>, maybe others?</li>\n</ul>",
