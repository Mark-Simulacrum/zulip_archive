The topic is our plans regarding rust-analyzer, the \"official\" choice of IDE, and rustc. The document summarizes our current thinking and also includes a section at the end for the discussion agenda. My hope is that people can review the doc now, before-hand. You can ask questions here if there are things that are unclear or could be clarified, and perhaps leave ideas for broader discussion topics in the document. Then we can prune the agenda on Thursday or so before the actual meeting.</p>\n<p>(the above note was written by <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"116009\">nikomatsakis</span> and lightly edited by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"133169\">@matklad</span> )</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116083\">@pnkfelix</span>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"153740\">@Igor Matuszewski</span>  we are especially interested in your feedback on the doc!</p>",
