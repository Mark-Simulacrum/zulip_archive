This looks a bit of a pain to maintain and potentially error-prone.<br>\nThe <a href=\"https://dhall-lang.org\" title=\"https://dhall-lang.org\">Dhall language</a> was designed for exactly this use-case: avoiding duplication in yaml files, in a robust way. Would you be open to use dhall to generate that file instead of yaml anchors ? I'm asking before I try to write a PR</p>",
