I wish <code>std</code> and the compiler were better separated and that <code>x.py</code> wasn't needed. To test a small change to <code>libstd</code> on Windows you need to go get Python first, probably wait some 40 minutes for LLVM to build, wait for the compiler (which always seemed to build one stage too many). That's quite a lot of stuff to ask for.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>fyi if you use <code>x.py test --stage 0 library/std</code> you can get rid of all those steps except getting python</p>",
