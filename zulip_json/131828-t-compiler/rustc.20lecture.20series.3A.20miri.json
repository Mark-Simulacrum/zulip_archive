Its design enables it to simulate the workings of the machine at a low-level, meaning that it can interpret not only \"safe Rust\" but also a lot of unsafe Rust code, including complex and highly optimized libraries like the stdlib hashmap. In this talk, compiler team member <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"124288\">oli</span> will dig into how miri works, giving us some insight into its architecture, the way that it represents and reasons about memory, and what kinds of capabilities it offers for Rust itself. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://zoom.us/j/379898279\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://zoom.us/j/379898279\">Join Zoom Meeting</a></p>",
