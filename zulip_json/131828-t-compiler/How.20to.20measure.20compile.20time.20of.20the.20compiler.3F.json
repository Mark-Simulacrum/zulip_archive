In response someone asked if my change affects the time it takes to compile the compiler. While I sure hope that's not the case, my intuition isn't exactly a reliable data point.<br>\nIs there some canonical way to perform this measurement? From what I've seen perf runs only check how quickly the compiler builds things and not how fast it gets built itself.<br>\nIf there's no canonical way, could I maybe make use of the fact that the only change is a few macro calls? E.g. if macro expansion happens already for <code>./x.py check</code>, I could measure that. Doing two full builds with my machine would be a challenge at best.</p>",
