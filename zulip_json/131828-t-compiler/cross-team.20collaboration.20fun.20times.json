I am trying to organize a meeting I call the <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/9tAEgpO1Sy2UTytnpkC9cA?view\">Cross Team Collaboration Fun Times (CTCFT)</a>. The idea is to help create a venue for teams to float ideas to one another, talk about things that affect the project, and generally have more collaboration and, well, fun. It would be a video call that would be recorded. I'd love to get feedback on the idea but also on possible recent events and agenda items. I'm looking to organize the first meeting in May.</p>",
