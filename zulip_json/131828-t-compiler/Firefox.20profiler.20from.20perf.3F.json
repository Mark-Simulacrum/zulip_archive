(I’d like to try to reverse this soon until we can complete that work — so that the recent runs don’t cause errors while the older do — and see if we can hide the links when they would fail, etc.) so it’s not your fault at all. if you really need to use the FF profiler for a run: you could download the raw profile, use the measureme tools to process it, and upload that to the profiler site</p>",
