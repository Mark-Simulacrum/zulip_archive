In general, I'm seeing regressions when replacing assignments with writes through pointers, even though the assembly for the containing function is exactly the same. I'm wondering if getting pointers involved is tripping up aliasing analysis in the context of inlining.</p>\n<p>The problem doesn't occur when I compile the code in isolation. But when compile it inside a larger program (rustc, actually), I think that the compiler makes different decisions with respect to inlining. It doesn't make much sense to me, because the function with this write isn't ever inlined anyway. It's the functions that _call_ it that get inlined a different number of times depending on how I do the write.</p>\n<p>Does anyone have insight as to what is going on? Or can at least point me to the area of the compiler that might be responsible?</p>",
