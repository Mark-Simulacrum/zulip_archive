However, we don't quite know how to do this the best way. There is <code>codegen_fulfill_obligation</code> which is already covered because it's a regular query but there are other things that are not separately measured. The time spent in those things will just be counted as part of whatever is invoking them. I guess, however, that <span class=\"user-group-mention\" data-user-group-id=\"692\">@WG-traits</span> will be interested in more detailed and specific numbers, right?</p>",
