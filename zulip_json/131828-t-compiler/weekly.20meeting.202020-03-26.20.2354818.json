The idea is that people expressed that it was hard to see how everything fits together. We now have a draft of Overview chapter, include a high-level walkthrough of what the compiler does to your code. We are planning to post to Inside Rust to solicit feedback.<br>\n    - Draft PR: <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-dev-guide/pull/633\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-dev-guide/pull/633\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-dev-guide/pull/633</a><br>\n    - Blog post to solicit feedback: <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/blog.rust-lang.org/pull/551\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/blog.rust-lang.org/pull/551\">https://github.com/rust-lang/blog.rust-lang.org/pull/551</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Went through nagisa's notes on backend and transcribed into a chapter about the compiler backend: <a href=\"https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/backend/backend.html\" title=\"https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/backend/backend.html\">https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/backend/backend.html</a><br>\n    - Still needs filling out a bit more (nagisa intended it to be a bit of survey)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Renamed rustc-guide to rustc-dev-guide<br>\n    - Blog post: <a href=\"https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/03/13/rename-rustc-guide.html\" title=\"https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/03/13/rename-rustc-guide.html\">https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/03/13/rename-rustc-guide.html</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Continue work on Overview chapter.</li>\n<li>We decided to collect a document with holes in the current backend chapters (there are a lot) and fill them in incrementally, since it seems none of the backend experts are available for a lecture/extended discussion:  <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/fTJHEkb5TXuKh2ClBL_c_w\" title=\"https://hackmd.io/fTJHEkb5TXuKh2ClBL_c_w\">https://hackmd.io/fTJHEkb5TXuKh2ClBL_c_w</a></li>\n<li>We want to do a cookbook-style appendix for PRs that help understanding some parts of the compiler.
