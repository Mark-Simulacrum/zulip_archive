        "content": "<p>Yeah, I'd recommend starting with an issue labeled <code>E-easy</code>. These issues tend to be <em>very</em> easy and have pretty much all of the instructions spelled out in the issue but they can be helpful in that they help you understand how to build the compiler and how the PR process works. Generally though, because they're so easy, you won't really learn much about that part of the compiler because it isn't required to fix the issue. At that point, I'd recommend looking for an <code>E-mentor</code> issue. These issues are quite a bit harder and you'll have to work to understand the code before jumping right to a fix however each of these issues has a designated person you can ask questions and get help from. There's also the <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"182449\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/182449-t-compiler.2Fhelp\">#t-compiler/help</a> stream where you can ask questions.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>",
