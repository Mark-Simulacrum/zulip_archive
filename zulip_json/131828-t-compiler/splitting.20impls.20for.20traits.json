It also makes errors a little bit weirder.</p>",

Now, i don't really want to add more stuff to this macro for declaring tags (which say if a rule is reccomended and other stuff), id rather it be a proc macro on the struct. However, i cannot do this if i cant split the impl for <code>CstRule</code> between what the macro makes and what the proc macro makes.</p>",
