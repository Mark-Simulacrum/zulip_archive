GDB 10 thinks generators are enums because generators have variant parts (and that is consistent with rustc). And the way GDB 10 to print enums are to find the first non-artificial field and print it. In generators, the first non-artificial part is an upvar so GDB 10 print an upvar as the body of the generator, which is meaningless.</p>\n<p>You can also refer my <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79009#issuecomment-826952708\">comment</a> in <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79009\">#79009</a> for a little more details.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, we should mark upvars artificial and we should not mark variant parts artificial. So GDB 10 will print something that looks good to me.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>(gdb) p b\n$2 = generator_objects::main::generator-0::Suspend0{c: 6, d: 7}\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>However, I checked the commit history and found that you <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/eb726c0fcec3f9d12a6a9990c5c041478e1e7187\">committed</a> the original code and you <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/887fbd9d3411ea7def2cc7a508d74bea6b7f19bb\">left</a> the following comments in <code>src/test/codegen/async-fn-debug.rs</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>// Verify debuginfo for async fn:\n//  - Each variant points to the file and line of its yield point\n//  - The generator types and variants are marked artificial\n//  - Captured vars from the source are not marked artificial\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I wonder if there are any reasons behind the original design.</p>\n<p>Hope my question doesn't bother you. And thanks for your explanation in advance.</p>",
