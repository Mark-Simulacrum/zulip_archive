Now they are per-revision which, I just realized now, allows you to write something along the lines of</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>// revisions: a b\n// [a] only-a\n// [b] only-b\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>instead of having to resort to a long list of <code>// ignore-*</code> in attempt to negate the <code>only-</code> directives. This will do exactly what you'd expect â€“ run the test for A or B.</p>",
