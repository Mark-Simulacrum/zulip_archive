It's a shortcut that is not going to end up even in draft PR.<br>\nI have committed first of the fix at <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/d87b0043778b83063b7e431c63bb1cf47bcbdac9\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/d87b0043778b83063b7e431c63bb1cf47bcbdac9\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/d87b0043778b83063b7e431c63bb1cf47bcbdac9</a><br>\nIt might be easier to understand if you look at the linker invocation first: <a href=\"https://www.diffchecker.com/GEuYFmzo\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.diffchecker.com/GEuYFmzo\">https://www.diffchecker.com/GEuYFmzo</a><br>\nOriginal invocation fails when linking together Rust and C objects because Rust ships mingw-w64 libraries that almost never happen to be compatible with user's mingw-w64 installation.<br>\nMy changes get system mingw-w64 libraries path and caches it (lines 905-933), libraries that are passed to the linker via their full path (<code>crt2.o</code> in this case) are first searched in system mingw-w64 installation (lines 936-944) and finally it prepends system mingw-w64 libraries search path before rust libraries (lines 1118-1123).<br>\nIMO the idea is good (code isn't) and I'd like to hear from the team about it.<br>\nNote: Because of <code>#[cfg(...)]</code> it works only on Windows but the same workaround is required when cross-compiling.</p>",
