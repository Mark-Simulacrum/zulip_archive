My sense from the survey is that especially new contributors feel a bit overwhelmed by the size of the project, and a handful of people explicitly commented that information is too scattered or that it is hard to find out what's going.</p>\n<p>My idea is to create a central location: contributing.rlo. We could move rustc-dev-guide, forge, compiler-team, and a bunch of other documentation there (I would prefer moving it over linking to it).</p>",
