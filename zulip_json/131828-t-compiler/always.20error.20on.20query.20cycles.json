It tries to get an optimized MIR and doesn't inline if a cycle occurred. This isn't really ideal for a number of reasons and I'd like to change it to use the unoptimized MIR for now. Long term I'd expect us to have a single query which handles inlining + MIR optimizations on the entire crate which does it's own cycle checking. cc <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"125250\">@Wesley Wiser</span></p>",
