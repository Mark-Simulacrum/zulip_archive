Tomorrow we have a design meeting to discuss <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues/209\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues/209\">compiler-team#209</a>, \"major changes proposal\". <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"124287\">@mw</span> and I drafted up a <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/MdbJvbO0SqmgxSV8K3JBEw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://hackmd.io/MdbJvbO0SqmgxSV8K3JBEw\">hackmd</a> here with some motivations and an initial draft proposal. The high-level summary, though, is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We want some kind of system where people advertise changes that they are making or plan to make <br>\n    * and the team can give high-level feedback early<br>\n    * and -- if we decide to go with the change -- we can ensure there is a reviewer beforehand</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please use this topic to give any feedback on the document or thoughts of how we should adjust it.</p>",
