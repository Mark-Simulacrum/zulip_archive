If you wanted to chat about <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/65672\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/65672\">#65672</a>, specifically why <code>GenKill</code> is implemented for <code>BitSet</code>, I'd be up for a quick sync discussion sometime in the next few days. Migrating the borrow-check analyses resulted in a <a href=\"https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=4b172cc73f5f1fb1e3d60527fb29605fa267985c&amp;end=31ca0fd7b109756a7c52baff29870d7831f3e723\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=4b172cc73f5f1fb1e3d60527fb29605fa267985c&amp;end=31ca0fd7b109756a7c52baff29870d7831f3e723\">~0.5% reduction in instruction count</a> for clean check builds of many non-trivial benchmarks, so this has moved up my list of priorities somewhat. Assuming that I haven't broken anything, my guess is that the reductions stem from overhead around <code>FlowsAtLocation</code>, which is no longer used, as well as the optimization discussed in the design meeting for acyclic MIR.</p>",
