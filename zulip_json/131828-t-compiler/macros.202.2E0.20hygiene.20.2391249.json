Basically, you can't reference, from outside of the macro, the name of a function defined in a macro 2.0 where the name text is in the macro itself (vs. being passed as an argument). My question: Is this intended behavior (i.e., always using def-site hygiene), or is it a bug?</p>",

Also, for future reference: please ping me when hygiene discussions like this come up, as they are exactly the sorts of discussions that I’d like to be aware of. :)</p>",
