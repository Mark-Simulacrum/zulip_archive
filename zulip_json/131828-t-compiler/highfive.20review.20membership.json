It has incomplete information and a contributor should always be able to say no to a given assignment.</li>\n<li>Being assigned a review that one does not have time or expertise for still incurs a bit of work and mental load, even when one declines the review in the end. It's often unclear how to proceed in that situation.</li>\n<li>Highfive knows nothing about PR priorities - but being assigned a PR by the system can sometimes lead to the assumption that \"this needs to get done asap\". </li>\n</ul>\n<p>I wonder if there is a good solution to that. highfive does not know how much time a given contributor actually has.</p>",
