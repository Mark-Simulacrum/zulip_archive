I had planned to write something like this fairly regularly (and writing it weekly would certainly make it easier, since the discussions would be fresher in my mind). But it's a lot of work, and it's unclear what the level of detail would be.</p>\n<p>There were two additional issues: first, I don't understand everything that was discussed. For instance, I see that there's some concern about how <code>pthread</code> error-handling interacts with <code>catch_unwind</code>, but I didn't have time to fully investigate the details. Second, I don't know how successful I was in avoiding bias; for instance, I don't really understand <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"126931\">@centril</span>'s concerns about letting <code>extern \"C\"</code> functions unwind, so it's possible that that section in my summary isn't fairly presented.</p>",
