You wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In other words, it's true that unsafe code can <strong>actively cause</strong> destructors not to run, either by using <code>mem::forget</code> or by creating a <code>Rc</code> cycle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><code>longjmp</code> is an \"active\" choice, too, and it requires <code>unsafe</code>. Unlike <code>mem::forget</code>, it has a non-local influence, but I think it's true in general of <code>unsafe</code> code. So the question of \"is it UB\" doesn't seem to be one of \"should we break <code>rayon</code>?\" but rather \"is it the programmer's responsibility to avoid using <code>rayon</code> and <code>longjmp</code> in the same thread?\" I believe the reasoning is the same for <code>pthread_exit</code>.</p>",
