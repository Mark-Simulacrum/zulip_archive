The few cases I tried from crater seem to work now, so I've enqueued a try build to re-run crater. It might be good if you want to take a quick look at the impl and see if there's terrible things I've done (in particular, the coercion-related code is a definite mess...)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/84573\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/84573</a> is the PR still, mostly the last 2 commits are relevant -- those are the new impl rework.</p>",
