Do you mind having a look and confirm that I am on the mark for the Overview before I dive in on a blog post draft about it?   Don't hesitate to mark up the hackmd document.   After this is discussed and there is a consensus on what the Overview will be, I will write up a detailed outline/initial blog post draft and circulate this for comments/collab work.  Thanks!</p>",

One things I noticed: The overview is not really meant as a standalone document at all. It is intend to become a chapter of the rustc-guide (but it's hard to draft things on github, so we do it on hackmd and open a PR later). One thing we found as a WG in a prior meeting is that the guide goes into a lot of detail about individual parts of the compiler, but people found it hard to grasp how those parts all fit together. The overview is intended as a way to remedy that problem a bit.</p>",

The links that I added to the Overview outline were simply for author reference as the document is created (including the Reference section links, this wasn't intended to be reader facing).  Santiago had a number of TODO's tagged for URL to areas of the Rustc Guide and I filled them in.   IMO something like a callout/admonition box with links to Rustc guide / source documentation (including the location of a source entry point) might be helpful at the end of each section if it is organized by phase.   The Guide ToC is readily available and simple to navigate.  This would save a click and scan of Guide docs in the case of source documentation / entry point links.</p>",
