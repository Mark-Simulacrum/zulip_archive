I'm by no means an expert, but I have been learning a lot about type theory, reading Pierce's book to help with the Oxide paper... The paper is brilliant and quite dense, with lots of information. </p>\n<p>However, section 4 is really nice and concrete. I think it might be helpful to others to include some of this material ( the examples in section 4) in the dev guide, as another way to introduce rustc's type context model. I think this could be done without requiring readers to learn all the type theory formalisms... Just a thought <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span>  Would love to discuss with folks.</p>",
