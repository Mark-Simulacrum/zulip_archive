Unfortunately, debugging support for <code>macro_rules</code> is not great these days.</p>\n<p>If you want to understand what the macro_rules parser does, I would recommend reading the comments in <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_expand/mbe/macro_parser.rs\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_expand/mbe/macro_parser.rs\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_expand/mbe/macro_parser.rs</a> and you could insert <code>log::debug</code> calls in that file to get the contents of various matchers and token streams. e.g. You can print the matchers (<code>ms</code>) here: <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/537ccdf3ac44c8c7a8d36cbdbe6fb224afabb7ae/src/librustc_expand/mbe/macro_parser.rs#L621\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/537ccdf3ac44c8c7a8d36cbdbe6fb224afabb7ae/src/librustc_expand/mbe/macro_parser.rs#L621\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/537ccdf3ac44c8c7a8d36cbdbe6fb224afabb7ae/src/librustc_expand/mbe/macro_parser.rs#L621</a> and you could print what is matched by printing these values: <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/537ccdf3ac44c8c7a8d36cbdbe6fb224afabb7ae/src/librustc_expand/mbe/macro_parser.rs#L636-L640\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/537ccdf3ac44c8c7a8d36cbdbe6fb224afabb7ae/src/librustc_expand/mbe/macro_parser.rs#L636-L640\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/537ccdf3ac44c8c7a8d36cbdbe6fb224afabb7ae/src/librustc_expand/mbe/macro_parser.rs#L636-L640</a> (I think)... I'm a bit rusty on this code (no pun intended).</p>\n<p>If you want to understand how procedural macros work, I'm afraid I can't really help, as I know almost nothing about how they work.
