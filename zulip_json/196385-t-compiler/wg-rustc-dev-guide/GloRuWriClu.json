It was presented to the ctcft aka Cross Team Collaboration Fun Times meeting on July 19th.  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116266\">@Santiago Pastorino</span>,  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"224872\">@rylev</span> and I have been working on applying  the framework to the rustc-dev-guide. It's ready to move forward and our target date for a synchronous kickoff meeting over Zoom is September 7th 2021. I'm hoping that many of you will want to join the cohort and increase your knowledge on the workings of rustc while producing some excellent documentation. There will be a sign up form posted on Friday. Here's the plan.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hackmd.io/69FQfH3PSOSJA3GHQ-5R2w\">https://hackmd.io/69FQfH3PSOSJA3GHQ-5R2w</a></p>",
