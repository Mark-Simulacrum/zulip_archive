Ideally this would indicate areas that are both educational AND helpful, but we would err towards the educational side as a quickstart self-onboarding guide to both begin to learn <code>rustc</code> and contribute to its development simultaneously.  IMO, this shouldn't <em>only</em> be about pointing to open \"easy\" issues or issues tagged as open to mentorship. It would be helpful to identify general areas of the source that a newcomer can feasibly touch, provide a brief explanation of <em>what</em> is \"easy\" to touch, and how to write a test around what a new developer touches.   Beyond that, we could add the <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/E-easy\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/E-easy\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/E-easy</a> URL to point directly to <code>E-easy</code> tagged items and information on how to interact with expertise for assistance as you undertake your first \"easy\" contribution to <code>rustc</code>.  There are open issues that offer mentorship and we might be able to formalize how that relationship works in the Guide (e.g., appropriate communication with your mentor- i.e., how not to annoy the hell out of your mentor which is always at the top of a newcomer's mind... <span aria-label=\"grinning\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f600\" role=\"img\" title=\"grinning\">:grinning:</span> ).</p>\n<p>Thoughts?</p>",
