Instead, the diagram visually shows how many compilers are built and how.</li>\n<li>it provides a relatively simple framework to understand why stuff is being built when it is (e.g. need to be ABI compatible).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, I'm not sure if the diagram is still accurate given the recent changes to bootstrapping and the defaults, but I think any diagram that satisfies the above details will make people happy.</p>\n<p>Moreover, I suspect that what might be most useful is for there to be two parts of the bootstrapping chapter: one for most people that just want to understand the basics enough to use x.py. I think this can have a diagram like the above that only talks about rustc and std and says \"but read the other part for more details about tools, docs, etc\". And the second part would go into all the gory details by fleshing out the simple diagram... In other words, it would start with the simple diagram as a base, and then explain all the missing parts.
