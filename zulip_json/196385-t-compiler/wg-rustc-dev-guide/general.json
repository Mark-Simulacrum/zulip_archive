        "content": "<p>Hi,</p>\n<p>by now I know I have not contributed much. However, I unfortunately cannot continue at this point. As of a recent job switch, I'm horribly exhausted due to an increase in work load. Also, I recently committed to training a local RoboCup team (robotics still being my favorite hobbyhorse), meaning that my evenings now will be very busy. That said and considering my own list or priorities I for now have to resign from contributing to rustc as I just don't know anymore how to fit this into my schedule. Sorry for letting you guys down, but for now this is the only feasible way for me. If at some point I again find the time to contribute, be sure I will call out once again.</p>",

Would it be possible for you to push your walkthrough chapter to a branch somewhere so that someone else can pick up from there? That way, we don't waste the effort you put into it. All the best in your future endeavors!</p>",
