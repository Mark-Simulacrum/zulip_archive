I laid out these goals in the docs stream on discord</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I've long wanted to make onboarding easier by giving a very detailed \"walkthrough\" for each of the ways of contributing in-tree that are <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\">listed in CONTRIBUTING.md</a>. Specifically, I want to provide an exact series of ./x.py and git commands that will are needed to, for example, check out, modify and build the standard library documentation.<br>\nDo others think this would be desirable and (more importantly) worth the maintenance burden?<br>\nSpecifically, there's some ./x.py workflows that AFAICT are not widely known and might alleviate common problems for newcomers (see <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/71458\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/71458</a>). Even just telling people what parts what things are going to be slow ahead of time (initial checkout, first build of LLVM if not using the system one) would make things less daunting for first-time contributors.</p>\n</blockquote>",
