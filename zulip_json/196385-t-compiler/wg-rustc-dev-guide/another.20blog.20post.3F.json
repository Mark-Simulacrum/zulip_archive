We have made a lot of progress since that post, and we\nhave also held a meeting to decide what to work on next. So let&#39;s dig in...\n\n## Work completed\n\nWe mentioned before that we are in the process of producing [rustc-guide][rg]\nchapters from the &quot;Compiler Lecture Series&quot; videos. The goal is to try to\nproduce guide chapters that are approachable for beginners and give a good\nfoundation for exploring and hacking on the compiler.\n\nRecently, we merge a [chapter][salsach] on [`salsa`][salsa] by `@Karrq`.\n`salsa` is a crate that makes incremental computation easier. While it is not\nused in `rustc` itself, it is heavily inspired by it, and it is used by\n[`rust-analyzer`][ra].\n\nWe also collectively have been working on a chapter about [`ty::Ty`][ty] and\nthe way that rustc represents types internally. You can find that PR\n[here][typr]. This has been a big effort for a few months now, and we are excited\nto have this new chapter in the guide.\n\n## What&#39;s next?\n\nWe just had a [planning meeting][meeting] to discuss what to work on next. The\nguide has some long-standing holes and shortcomings that we would like to address.\n\nSpecifically, the Learning WG decided that we wanted to pursue the following goals next:\n- Write an overview chapter\n- Gather source matterial for chapters on monomorphization and LLVM\n\n### Overview chapter\n\nOne of the challenges with big software systems is understanding how everything\nfits together. We seen this problem come up with the rustc-guide; the chapters\ntunnel down into a single part of the compiler, but it is hard to get a good\nview of all the things that happen to a piece of code between lexing and linking.\n\nWe want to remedy this problem by creating an Overview chapter that walks\nthrough some example from the beginning of the compiler to the end of the\ncompiler at a high level.  We plan to put this chapter at the beginning of\n(part 2 of) the guide, so that it guide readers as to what part of the\ncompilation they are reading about in the subsequent chapters.\n\n### Monomorphization, Codegen, LLVM\n\nOne of the biggest gaps in the guide currently is what happens to your code\nafter the MIR is produced. We have chapters on almost everything that happens\nbefore that (though many of them are pretty slim), but we have almost nothing\nafter the MIR is produced, borrow checked, and optimized.\n\nIn particular, after the MIR is optimized, we need to [monomorphize][glos] it,\nproduce LLVM IR from it, call LLVM to produce executable code, and then link\neverything to form a final binary object.\n\nThe Learning WG will work on collecting information to write chapters on these\ntopics.\n\n## Getting involved\n\nDid any of this sound interesting to you? We would love for you to join us! You\ncan the Learning WG on the [`t-compiler/wg-learning`][zulip] stream on Zulip.\nFeel free to stop by and ping us.\n\n\n[oct]: https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2019/10/28/rustc-learning-working-group-introduction.html\n[rg]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rustc-guide/\n[salsa]: https://crates.io/crates/salsa\n[salsach]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rustc-guide/salsa.html\n[ra]: https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer\n[ty]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/ty/type.Ty.html\n[typr]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-guide/pull/530\n[meeting]: https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/196385-t-compiler.2Fwg-learning/topic/planning.20meeting\n[glos]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rustc-guide/appendix/glossary.html\n[zulip]: https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/196385-t-compiler.2Fwg-learning\n</pre></div>",
