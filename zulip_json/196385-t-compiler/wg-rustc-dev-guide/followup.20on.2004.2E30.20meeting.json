In particular, we already have \"walkthrough of contributing to rustc\" and \"high level overview of the compiler\" chapters.</li>\n<li>I think part of what makes the rustc-guide feel disorganized is that there is no \"flow\". Each chapter was written by a different person, and there is no common narrative flowing through it. Moreover, each chapter is organized differently.<ul>\n<li>One solution to this might be to decide that each chapter will be organized the same way. e.g...<ul>\n<li>The top level chapter will explain the contents of whole chapter (like a detailed Table of Contents for that chapter)</li>\n<li>The first sub-chapter should be a high-level overview of the technical content</li>\n<li>All subsequent sub-chapters contain the actual technical content of the chapter</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>I think having a \"here is the path your program takes through rustc\" chapter is a great idea, as it helps put all the pieces into context.</li>\n</ul>",
