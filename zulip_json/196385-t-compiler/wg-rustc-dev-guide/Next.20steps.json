It would be helpful to have source <strong>entry point</strong> links for each of these sections in the Overview.  This would serve as a jumping off point where readers can begin to explore the source after they read a section of the Overview.  It would also be helpful to succinctly summarize (or link to references that describe) available approaches to explore the various levels of source representation to machine code during the compile process.   e.g., <code>cargo rustc -- -Zunpretty=hir-tree</code> for HIR.  This would support an approach for readers to draft small bodies of source and visualize levels of representation as they run through the Overview and dig deeper into detailed information in the sections of the rustc guide.</p>\n<p>I will get started on the Overview blog post outline this evening.</p>",
