I still  haven't  finished reading the whole book, but instead I have a bunch of tiny pet  projects in Rust, from synthesizer VSTs to a <code>wc</code> clone, adventofcode exercise solutions, and others. I'm currently pursuing MSc in CS, taking  some programming languages  &amp; compilers courses soon to get more  insight into what happens under the hood. I'm also working as a backend engineer, with a history of fullstack dev, devops, sysadmin, IT support,  etc.<br>\nYou can find me as Walther on here, on  many of  the Discords, GitHub, and as @anotherwalther on Twitter.</p>",
