I'm interested in exploring WASM and I've experimented with it a bit but I have tons of questions. What is the best/most natural place where to ask WASM questions without spamming too many people and reaching the right ones? I saw links to #WG-wasm discord channel but that doesn't seem to exist (or doesn't show up for me).</p>",

My problem was that the link to <code>wg-wasm</code> I found on Gloo was showing a Discord error (error loading messages). Following a Discord link from rustwasm pointed to \"accept the code of conduct\". I could then see <code>wg-wasm</code>. The Gloo link also started working now.</p>",
