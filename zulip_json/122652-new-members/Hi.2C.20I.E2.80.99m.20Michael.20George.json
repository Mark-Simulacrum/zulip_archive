I’ve been teaching a broad range of subjects in computer science at Cornell for the past 7 years - functional programming, oop, discrete math, operating systems, data structures and algorithms, and I have a strong interest in languages and language design.  Recently I’ve been wanting to get back into building real systems, which is part of why I’ve started learning rust.</p>\n<p>I’m interested in the trait system - my favorite language learning project (exact arithmetic with irrational numbers) quickly made me really want implied trait bounds, which in turn led me to the project to integrate chalk into rustc.  I would be interested in learning more about that and trying out any prototypes that exist; if I could be helpful, I might have some time to pitch in, though I’m new to large OSS projects and rust programming.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, I’m looking for a job.  If you think I might be a good candidate for you, please email me at <a href=\"mailto:mdgeorge@cs.cornell.edu\">mdgeorge@cs.cornell.edu</a>.</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>",
