        "content": "<p>日本語 の「っち」は英語で「\"cchi\"」になるともっともっとインパクトのあるおもう。<br>\nI would not render どっち into \"dochy\", only \"docchi\". That doubled \"ch\" (into \"cch\") matters a lot to the native English speaker.<br>\nFor instance,<br>\n\"hatter\" vs. \"hater\"<br>\nThe first one is said like \"hatt-er\". We have a bump on the \"t\" sound twice, and while we generally don't actually make two \"t\" sounds, it makes the \"a\" much shorter and the \"er\" more distinct from the rest. Linguists sometimes transcribe it as /ˈhatə(r)/<br>\nFor the second one, \"hater\", the \"t\" is only hit once, and it sounds like \"haet-r\". The vowels seem to blur together, making that initial vowel into a diphthong. In IPA: /ˈheɪtə(r)/<br>\nAlso some accents will pronounce the \"r\" in hatter but not hater or vice-versa, but both will end with ə.</p>\n<p>That's why people look at \"dochy\" and see \"douchey\". Because \"doch\" and \"douch\" can sound a lot more like each other in English.<br>\nAnd at the end, the \"e\" can get \"y\" inserted before it \"for free\".</p>",
