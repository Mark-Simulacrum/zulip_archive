I know some work is happening (see <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/portable-simd/pull/270\">https://github.com/rust-lang/portable-simd/pull/270</a> for example), so I suspect there's interest in more rustdoc examples too.  I suggest joining the <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"257879\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/257879-project-portable-simd\">#project-portable-simd</a> stream here, if you haven't already, as most of the related conversation is happening there.</p>",
