I wanted to help improve rust since I've found it so useful in my personal projects (mostly emulators and a JIT compiler). So far I've only worked on a couple of diagnostics issues, but I think I'd like to get more involved with constant evaluation stuff. It'd be great if I could get some pointers on how I could help.</p>",

I originally made it for my PS1 emulator, but it's generic enough to work with other MIPS I console emulators. It's definitely a WIP though since I have some bugs in my register allocator.</p>",
