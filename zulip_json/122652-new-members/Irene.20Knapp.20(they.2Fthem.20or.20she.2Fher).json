(If you see me use \"we\" to refer to myself sometimes, it's for reasons described at <a href=\"https://pluralpride.com\">https://pluralpride.com</a>.) I'm new to Rust but excited about it. I joined the chat because a friend let me know about the FFI-unwind working group, which I'm excited to be part of because of my experience with FFI issues in other languages. Glad to meet you all!</p>",
