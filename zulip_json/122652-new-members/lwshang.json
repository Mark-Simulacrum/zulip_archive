I'm not an expert in Rust programming but want to contribute to the community. Thanks to niko's post recently, I finally find this right place . <br>\nI made some contributions to rust-lang on github by correct outdated links in those READMEs. And I'm working on a Rust binding for kdb+/q which is a proprietary column-based database/SQL software that is widely used in finance. Therefore, FFI is one of my recent interests. I'm exploring Rust to get some other topics to try.<br>\nI've some experience to manage small group of people and I enjoy the feeling to gather the advantages of every one to accomplish some goals. So I would like to help organize meetings and other efforts to promote the development of Rust.<br>\nSince I'm new here. Could you guys please guide me to the working-groups which want an organizer or just a contributor? Looking for your response!</p>",
