I've been contributing to rust for a while now, but I'm only now joining the Zulip.</p>\n<p>I'm interested in solving the FIXME that's been in the stdlib for ages now: Add block-buffering to stdout when appropriate. To my mind this means detecting if you're in a terminal session (whatever that means on your platform). However, there was also some discussion in the github issue suggesting that it might be preferable to make it a manual switch <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/60673\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/60673</a>. Would this change be significant enough to call for an RFC, or is it the sort of thing where I could create a proposed design in a PR and let discussion continue from there?</p>",
