I'm Alex, I prefer she-her or they-them, I'm a long time enthusiast of Rust and decided to probe the water in more of a core development.<br>\nI'm not currently being paid to do Rust fulltime, so I haven't had a chance to write anything serious yet, with a team of one.<br>\nHowever, my area of interest (GPU and GPGPU) relies heavily on libraries that use or could use unstable extensions, so I want to settle in and try to further their design and implementation process. My first sight is on safe transmute, then I hope to graduate to code-emitting backends.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to meeting you all!<br>\nP.S. I'm new to Zulip so please be patient with me for a little while until I learn the search functions properly. :/</p>",
