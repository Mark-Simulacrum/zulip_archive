I have been reading a lot of Rust code over the past few days and my primary interest is in working with compilers, so coming here seemed like the natural choice. I have currently claimed <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/87211\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/87211</a> and looking forward to fixing this asap. As the discussion points out, it seems to be a straightforward fix right now, but I can't wait to dig deeper.<br>\nI am really happy to be here. Cheers!</p>",
