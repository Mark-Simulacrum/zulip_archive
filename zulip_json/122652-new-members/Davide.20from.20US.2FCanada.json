I was on a roadtrip a week ago in Oregon, and I read the rust documentation for over 5 hours! I'm completely new to this kind of open community, but really want to meet cool people and to contribute to projects. I'm focused on quantum simulation, but enjoy programming (and math) as an art. Long term my goal is to be head of a lab trying to simulate a cell atomistically. I'm so glad to meet all of you! If anything I mentioned sounds interesting to you, please DM me.</p>",
