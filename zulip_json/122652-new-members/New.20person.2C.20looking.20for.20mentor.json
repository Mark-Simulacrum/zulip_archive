Are there tasks that I can do that would also allow me to get familiar with the rustc code base and development process? I would like to eventually work up to the point of being able to participate in conversations about the type system, type/lifetime inference and other semantic analysis issues, and the algorithm design that services those aspects of the compiler. But right now I think I am at the software engineering equivalent of, “sweep the floors,” rather than, “design the building,” by which I mean I don’t know enough to be of use in major infrastructure conversations yet.</p>",
