Professionally I work in the intersection between software engineering &amp; deep learning, but I'm much more interested in the former than the latter.</p>\n<p>Currently I'm contributing to <code>clippy</code>. Once I become productive there, I'd hope to explore <code>cargo</code> and <code>compiler</code>.</p>",
