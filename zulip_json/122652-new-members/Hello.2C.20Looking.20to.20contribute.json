Professionally I'm a Senior Data Engineer in Berlin. My areas of interest are databases (specifically PostgreSQL), stream processing, message systems like Kafka, and I've done extensive work in Google Cloud platform. Personally I'm learning more about internals of how compilers work (something that excites me but I am a novice at). I'd love to have any pointers on how to get started with contributions in those areas. Thanks a lot!</p>",

We are also running the <a href=\"#narrow/stream/196385-t-compiler.2Fwg-learning\" title=\"#narrow/stream/196385-t-compiler.2Fwg-learning\">learning working group</a> which one of the main objectives is to make the learning rustc process better. I'd like to invite you to join and make those guides even better :)</p>",
