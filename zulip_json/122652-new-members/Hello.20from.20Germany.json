I'm lucky to be working with Rust in the near future. My main interests will be build speed and C++ interoperability, but I'm excited about pretty much everything rusty :)</p>\n<p>Some background, after a failed PhD attempt, and a failed startup attempt in Ruby with university friends, I worked a few years on Bazel, and I worked on C++ Interop in Swift for the past year. In general I'm just horribly incompetent but enthusiastic about stuff :)</p>\n<p>I'm looking forward to chatting with you all :)</p>",
