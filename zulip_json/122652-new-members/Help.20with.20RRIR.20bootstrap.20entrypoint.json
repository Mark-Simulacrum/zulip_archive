        "content": "<p>Hi all. I am currently working on making <code>x.py</code> unnecessary by moving the functionality from python into the main Rust bootstrap binary (<a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/94829\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/94829</a>). There are a <em>lot</em> of parts to this and some of the work can be parallelized. The rustup support especially is pretty self-contained and not terribly complicated. If anyone wants to help out, here are some good starting points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/issues/2970\">rustup#2970</a>: \"Add support for install --profile bare\"</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/94828#issuecomment-1066988061\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/94828#issuecomment-1066988061</a>: Move fake rustc/rustdoc from separate binaries in the bootstrap package to a single binary that dispatches on the name (like the rustup proxies do)</li>\n<li>Investigate a file locking mechanism for rust. There are currently <em>many</em> copies of these but no library crate. If someone wants to publish a cross-platform crate for file locking that would be extremely helpful. See <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/88310#discussion_r695302393\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/88310#discussion_r695302393</a> for some existing discussion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am currently working on rewriting <code>download-llvm</code> into rust, so it doesn't make sense to have multiple people work on it at once. I'll update my status when I finish - it may or may not be easy to have people help me with <code>download-rustc</code>.</p>",
