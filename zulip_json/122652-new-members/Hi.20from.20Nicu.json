I would still consider myself a newbie in Rust, but I really enjoy working with the language. I'm also into programming languages and compilers, and lately I've been reading about the internals of rustc and related projects. It is certainly interesting to see the differences and similarities between a production-grade compiler and what I was taught in my university course.<br>\nI am currently mostly interested in <code>rust-analyzer</code> and would like to do something related to it for my thesis project. I have already exchanged a couple of emails with matklad and hopefully something interesting and useful comes out of this.</p>",
