I don't think there's a strict preference, though I wouldn't be surprised if the participation in each of those forums differs. If you have a lot of thoughts already worked out, then maybe the best thing would be to post a Pre-RFC to internals.rlo, and then link to it from Zulip for visibility?</p>",
