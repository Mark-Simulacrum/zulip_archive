My main interest here at the moment is to explore Rust's ownership and lifetime system. At the moment I am in the research stage and hope to transition into a thesis on the topic this summer. If anyone has any pointers (heh), points of contact, or things they could share about the ownership system I would love to hear them.</p>\n<p>Nice to meet you,</p>\n<p>Rowan</p>",
