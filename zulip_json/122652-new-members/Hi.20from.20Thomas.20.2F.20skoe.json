Today I'm old (but still childish sometimes) and do things that are only slightly more serious, mostly embedded systems like telephony and network equipment or medical devices. Most of my work is done in C and Python, but sometimes there's also some C++ or even VHDL. I'm happy that there's Rust with the performance of C and the comfort and tools like Python and the safety like.... erm... nothing else. Currently I can't use it for my real work, that's why I spend my spare time with it. </p>\n<p>As usually I start at the lowest level, that's why I came here to find answers :)</p>",
