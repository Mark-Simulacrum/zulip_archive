Currently I've only worked on some small personal projects, but I wanted to try some bigger projects and what better way to do that than working on the compiler (and all the tools around it). I'm currently also doing a Master's programme focused on programming technology, so it's kinda in character. I already started working on <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/53278\">regex support for test filters</a>, and I am looking forward to talking to some of you!</p>",
