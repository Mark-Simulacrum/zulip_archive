I'd be interested in trying to do something bigger, for instance helping with the move to the query-based approach or implementing some optimisation.  However, I don't have a very clear idea of what I could do specifically, and I'm struggling to find issues of this form.  What would the usual procedure for getting started on something like this be?  I occasionally hear about mentoring, but I'm not sure how to find someone to ask.</p>",

I don't know if this is the official answer, but a lot of the teams have regular (or at least semi-regular) meetings that are open to anyone. Some of them happen over Zulip, so to attend you just have to watch your Zulip window at the right time. For example, the Async Working Group meets at 10pm PDT in <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"187312\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/187312-wg-async-foundations\">#wg-async-foundations</a>. I've found showing up at meetings a good way to learn more about what's going on and get connected with the people that can help.</p>\n<p>If you're interested in working on the query system, I'd suggest asking in <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"131828\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler\">#t-compiler</a> and somewhere there can hopefully point you better in the right direction.</p>",
