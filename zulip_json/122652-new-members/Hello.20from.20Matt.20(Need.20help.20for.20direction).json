For Rust, I only finished reading the 20 chapters Rust book, and played around a little.  I want to contribute to the community via proving some codings. I am looking for some larger group coding experience and coding on Rust experience. Do you guys have any recommendation for which group should I look at?  I did look into the easy label Rust issues, which mostly are claimed or doc issues right now. <br>\nI can spent time to dig deep into certain topic, where it needs more help right now. But since I am only a undergrad student, I can not be an expert in a short period. I do not know which group should I look for. <br>\nThank you for all replies in advance.</p>",

I have learned compiler(scanner, parser, scheduling, allocation, optiomzation ... ) a little while ago but not intermediate in anyway. I do not know if this level is enough to help the compiler people. I am looking for some projects that are active with maybe 5 or more people? Just want to learn how people cooperate in a larger open source project.</p>",
