I worked on compiler with intermittent intervals on Atomics, match arms, valgrind checks, some soundness tests. My mentor is <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"124288\">@oli</span>  and I want to work on miri related things. Currently there are couple of open and closed PRs to some <code>I-unsound</code> and Miri related things from my side. I am happy to work on these topics. I might need heavy guidance because I didn't contributed for a long time. + recent LLVM ICEbreaker here.</p>",
