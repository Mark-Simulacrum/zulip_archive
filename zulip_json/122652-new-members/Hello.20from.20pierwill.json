Been doing technical things for a few years now but never really thought I liked programming or programming languages <em>as such</em>â€”until I started learning Rust! </p>\n<p>I've been strangely drawn to rustc and its magic, and have started to submit some docs PRs as I try to grasp bits here and there. Looking forward to chatting with y'all and contributing !</p>",
