I mostly live on Discord (cky#6493), but it's certainly quite lively here on Zulip so I thought I'd join in too. :-)</p>\n<p>I strive to learn a new programming language every year, and 2020 was my year of Rust. It's been a lot of fun! (2019 was my year of Swift, and 2018 was my year of Kotlin; there are enough conceptual similarities between Rust, Swift, and Kotlin that I enjoy comparing them side by side in implementing various small projects.)</p>\n<p>When I learn a language, I don't do it by halves; by the end of each year, my aim is to be well acquainted enough with the language to be able to write production-quality projects. I've been programming professionally for about 20 years (my current day job is in Ruby), so I strive to meet pretty high standards.</p>\n<p>My current project is implementing a Discord bot; the current bot I use on our Discord server is written in Ruby, and the code is a bit clunky in places, so I look forward to a clean rewrite!</p>",
