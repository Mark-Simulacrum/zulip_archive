Though I've only used Rust on and off for the past year or so, I've had a great experience with the language. I'd love to contribute back to the project as well as acquire better knowledge of the internals. I have some experience with functional languages (OCaml and Haskell) and am interested in topics from concurrency to devtools. (As a side note, I'd love to learn about the compiler/explore that field as well)</p>",

If you want to learn more about how the compiler works, you can look at the <a href=\"https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/\"><code>rustc-dev-guide</code></a>.
