I think the latter looks nicer, but can lead to some ambiguities that are generally handled well. Adding <code>rust_</code> or <code>rust-</code> or <code>-rs</code>, it's generally frowned upon because it's already clear you're in Rust and typing <code>meta_vars_rs::foo()</code> gets old pretty quickly.</p>",
