I haven't had a chance to work with nontrivial Rust code, but I'm super interested in compilers and related theory, and so I was interesting in helping out, in whatever way I can. I'm not totally sure where to start, but from the projects I've seen, rustc, miri, and chalk seem fairly interesting to me.</p>",
