However, I'm really open to just getting stuck in so can join in where needed? (Any pointers to projects would be great?)</p>\n<p>My main blocker to getting started would be learning (or going through) the PR submission process a couple of times, so I might need a little bit of hand holding -- is there any low-hanging fruit or janitorial tasks that I could make a start with to get me going?</p>",
