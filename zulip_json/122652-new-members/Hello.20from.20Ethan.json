I've recently been using Rust to speed up a quantum compiler at work. I'm interested in learning more about mir-opts and I am looking forward to getting more familiar with the internals of the compiler :)</p>",

I've started looking through the rustc dev guide, I think I am going to work on understanding the compiler pipeline first, but then I will probably start looking at mir-opts.
