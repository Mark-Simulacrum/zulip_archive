I began in spatial computing very early in my career with robotics, using the programming language Forth - an interesting language that speaks machine and human efficiently. Currently, I work at Futurewei Technologies and I'm focused on the open web for spatial computing  with Rust/Web Assembly as the foundation.  I'm  so excited that Rust/Wasm  can enable an open approach to the spatial web at a time when reality is increasingly becoming the platform for computing.</p>",
