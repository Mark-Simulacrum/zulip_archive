I'm thinking about syntactic sugar for dummy closures wrapping single method calls, i.e. in place of  <code>x.apply(|y| { o.some(y); })</code>, use something like <code>x.apply(o::some)</code> or <code>x.apply(move o::some)</code>. It seems possible to gather all required information about types, modifiers and lifetimes from the context to automatically generate wrapping closure. What do you think about it? Are there any RFC, nightly feature or discussions on this subject?</p>",
