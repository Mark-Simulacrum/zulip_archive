I managed to get my first PR merged in the compiler last week and I'm quite proud and I'd like to become way more involved in the future as I've been using and preaching Rust for a while now. I'm a bit lost to be fully honest tho. I stumbled randomly upon for the PR i worked on. Any part of the compiler someone could point me at? The project is so big that it's a bit hard to know where to start</p>",
