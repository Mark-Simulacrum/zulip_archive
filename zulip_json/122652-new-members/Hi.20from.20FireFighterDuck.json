Chalk's approach of lowering trait dependencies into logic programs fascinates me and I hope to be able to contribute something to the project in the long run. Other than Rust, I'm also interested in both programming language design/compiler construction and program verification/automatic proving; both topics that overlap in Chalk. <br>\nI'm looking forward to learn a lot around here and hopefully I'll be able to help out a bit in the process as well.</p>",
