The pipeline is relatively simple:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>extract the fully qualified name of all functions/methods declared in the crate.</li>\n<li>create an hyperlink to the documentation of said function.</li>\n<li>extract from the AST/IR/…? the fully qualified name of all called functions. Ideally also extract all <code>Fn</code>, Trait parameters and other means to inject function dependencies</li>\n<li>create a graph of dependencies, export it with graphviz</li>\n<li>displays the graph</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where should I get the information for step 1 and step 3? I guess that rust-analyser and rustc are my best bet. I could also look at llvm IR? I'm proficient both in C++ and Rust, so even if I'd like to do this project in Rust, if it's easier to extract the information using C++ libraries it's totally ok for me.</p>",
