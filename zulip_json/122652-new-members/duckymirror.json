I'm interested in learning how the Rust compiler works and I'd like to contribute more than doc comments for From implementations (yes, I'm talking about <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/51430\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/51430</a>) when I'm ready and see an opportunity. As my Rust experience is pretty limited and I know basically nothing about the compiler (I'll read the rustc dev guide next) this is likely going to take a while.</p>",
