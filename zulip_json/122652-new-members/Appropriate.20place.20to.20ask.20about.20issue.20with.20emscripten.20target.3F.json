I've documented some of what I know over at: <a href=\"https://github.com/gregbuchholz/thread_local_storage\">https://github.com/gregbuchholz/thread_local_storage</a> .  Would this be something I could / should post as an issue on <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust</a> ?  Or might it be better suited to <a href=\"https://github.com/emscripten-core/\">https://github.com/emscripten-core/</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/\">https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/</a> ?  Or some other forum?  Thanks!</p>",
