I opened <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/87047\">my first PR</a> (a small addition to the standard library) a few days ago, and since then have received some high-level feedback, but not much else. Since the addition definitely seems like something people have varying opinions on, would it be appropriate to request a pFCP be started at this point? If not, then what is the appropriate course of action? I've read through <a href=\"https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/implementing_new_features.html\">the guide to implementing new features</a> but because my addition is specifically an <code>impl</code> (which are \"insta-stable\" per <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/55436#issuecomment-433692314\">#55436</a>), I'm not sure that everything applies (as I <em>can't</em> mark this as unstable).</p>",
