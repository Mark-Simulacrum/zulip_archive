While I have not used it for a ton of projects, I have always enjoyed writing Rust when I do. I am hoping I can hang around here and get some perspective on how production compilers are run and maybe contribute here and there and improve my skills!</p>",

        "content": "<p>Hi Jake! If you want to contribute to the rust compiler, or just want to know how it works internally, the <a href=\"https://rust-lang.github.io/rustc-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://rust-lang.github.io/rustc-guide/\">rustc guide</a> is a good starting point. There are still some missing chapters though. I don't know which parts of a compiler you are most interested in (parser, type checking, codegen, ...), but you can find easy issues at <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label:E-easy\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label:E-easy\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label:E-easy</a>. There is also the <code>E-mentor</code> label for issues where there is a specific person willing to answer any questions. Even if the <code>E-mentor</code> label is not added, you can still ask questions though. When you have picked an issue, you may want to comment <code>@rustbot claim</code> to notify others that you are already working on it. Good luck!</p>",
