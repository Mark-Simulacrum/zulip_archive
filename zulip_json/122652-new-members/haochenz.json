The goal of our project is to visualize the move and borrow of the variable resource (mapped to a memory chunk) to better enhance the user experience of Rust programmers. We are now in the state of finding a solution to autogenerate these visualizations and Polonius definitely seemed promising and within our range. As I finished watching niko's talk, read a few blogs and tried to use the tool myself, I still found it difficult to comprehend Polonius's usage and how it achieved that,  and therefore had a difficult time relating Polonius with our project. If anyone knows where should I post these questions I'd really appreciate that! I'd also love to work on any aspect of the Polonius. Looking forward to share the passion for Rust with everyone in this community! Here's a link of our project repo (<a href=\"https://github.com/rustviz/rustviz\">https://github.com/rustviz/rustviz</a>)  and Published Paper (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09012\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09012</a>)</p>",
