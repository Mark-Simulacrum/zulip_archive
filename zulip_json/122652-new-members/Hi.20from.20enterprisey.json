I've been meaning to try and write a couple of name resolution patches for a while (<a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/63720\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/63720</a> and adding an additional note for the \"unresolved import\" error if there's a binary crate with the same name). I just ran into the latter issue again, which motivated me to join this Zulip and try again. I have been using Rust for two years, and at work I write assemblers and linkers.</p>",
