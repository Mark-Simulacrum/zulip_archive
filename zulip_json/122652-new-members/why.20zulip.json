I can not agree more. Such difficult to track busy channel, seniors don't read large channels, remote workers can't participate, and prefer to use DM.</p>\n<p>I can relate to all of these. But this is my first time with Zulip (never heard of it before). Let's see if it is better.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>By the way, I try to find the initial announcement of rust teams moving to Zulip and Discord. Some of them are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/5943\">Clippy teams</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/the-library-team-is-moving-from-irc-to-zulip/11598\">Library teams</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am curious what teams moved to Zulip first. and how come other teams decide to use another platform. Is each rust team has it is own rules?</p>\n<p>I mean, is there no such thing as central government? such a vote so that every team uses the same platform.</p>",

No, there is no central government - there is the RFCs repo for major changes to the language, but it doesn't govern \"small\" or internal things like what platform to use. The way each team makes decisions is also up to them - T-compiler mostly uses MCPs or weekly meetings, while T-rustdoc uses FCPs a lot more because we don't have meetings.</p>",
