Recently spend 20@25 hours on this language  for compile some algorithm in rust and using/calling in python, Rust language it's awesome.</p>\n<p>I really interesting  to make some performance papers comparing operative research algorithm in rustlang with others languages and share or publish.  Let me know if there some scientific team in Rust community to get into.</p>\n<p>Thank you for all replies in advance,</p>\n<p>Rod.</p>",
