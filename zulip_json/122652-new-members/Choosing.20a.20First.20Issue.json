I really enjoyed the experience and I'd like to start contributing to the Rust compiler.</p>\n<p>I'm not really sure where to get started in choosing a first issue. I read the guide on contributing to the compiler which answered \"how to contribute\" but I'm left unsure on \"how to pick an issue\" (Which issue to pick, how to gain problem background, who to talk to with questions, etc). </p>\n<p>I'm thinking a good spot to start on a LLVM related task. Could anyone please point me in the best direction?</p>",
