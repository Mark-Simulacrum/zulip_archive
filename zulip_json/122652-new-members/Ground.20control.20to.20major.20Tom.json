If someone is rewriting any Python tool to Rust (personal tool or community tool), let me know and maybe I can help with. One of my favorite ways of learning is contributing. Today I'm mostly working with Python FastAPI and I'm learning Rocket to understand Rust inside my current perspective.<br>\nLet me know how deep the rabbit hole is.</p>",
