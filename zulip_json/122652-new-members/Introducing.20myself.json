The long-term problems with the query system are the compilation time, the runtime performance, and parallelization.<br>\nThis is closely tied with the incremental compilation work, you may want to check on the incr-comp working group. You may also want to check on the salsa project (<a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/salsa\">https://github.com/rust-lang/salsa</a>), which will replace rustc's custom query system eventually.</p>",
