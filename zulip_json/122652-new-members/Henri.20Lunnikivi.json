        "content": "<p>Hi! I'm a PhD student at Tampere University in Finland. I've been writing Rust for 4 years after 'moving on' from 6 years of C++ (= prototypes for Nokia, game engines for fun, game engines for Rovio Entertainment, ... blah blah). I like high performance stuff and I really like programming, but I dislike wasting time debugging runtime issues that can be detected at compile time. I'm writing my dissertation on using Rust in machine learning and embedded. My goal is to make a blip in the university radar and create opportunity for people to learn to write really good and robust software, since I feel that it's really a lot easier to learn that with Rust than it is with C++.</p>\n<p>I recently almost succeeded in arranging for a public Rust-workshop for everyone interested around the campus (and the whole country apparently), but we had to postpone due to instructions regarding the COVID-19 outbreak. I'm also trying to ease into compiler internals via contributing on clippy. Finally, I enjoy wasting people's time by telling programming jokes to a large audience, they laugh but it may be second-hand embarrassment (you never know).</p>",
