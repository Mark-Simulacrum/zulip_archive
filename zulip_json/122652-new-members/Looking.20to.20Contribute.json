Trial By Fire ! <br>\n'<br>\n2. It taught me that some nice people like Niko (thanks for inviting me) are always willing to help out and lend a hand to people who want to help but don't know where to start. <br>\n'<br>\nAside from that if you guys have any needs then I will try to help as much as I can. Also, If theirs anything I need to improve before I can help in-certain areas please don't hesitate to tell me how I can improve and acquire those skills.</p>",
