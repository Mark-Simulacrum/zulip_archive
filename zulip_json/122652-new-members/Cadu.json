I am a 30ish computer programmer from Brazil who just recently (finally \\o/) got the chance to properly leverage Rust and all its speed and fearless concurrency in a project <span aria-label=\"happy\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f600\" role=\"img\" title=\"happy\">:happy:</span> I use rust-analyzer daily and I found a simple formatting bug, I just forked the repo and I'm going to try to fix it and contribute back. I figured I should get in touch with the community as well. Maybe there's more stuff I can do to contribute? </p>\n<p>I also like making music in my spare time with trackers (Renoise) and also Puredata. If you're into music stuff, hit me too :P</p>",
