First time i join zulip but i've been wanting to contribute to rust compiler/stdlib for a while now and did not know where to start so i asked <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116011\">@Steve Klabnik</span> and he told me that joining the chat might be a good starting point :) I've (partially) read the dev guide and be happy to be mentored on an actual issue!
