Have been using Rust for about 2 years for fun, and it's been the most wonderful experience I've ever had in my programming life!<br>\nRecently I contribute to <a href=\"https://github.com/denoland/deno\">the Deno project</a>, particularly its linter <a href=\"https://github.com/denoland/deno_lint\">deno_lint</a>. I believe this experience makes myself be skillful enough to do something valuable for the rust-lang project. Also, I'm sure that what I will learn from the rust-lang project is absolutely beneficial to improving Deno even better! This is why I decided to join here.<br>\nHopefully I will become a member of the rust-lang organization in the future <span aria-label=\"grinning\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f600\" role=\"img\" title=\"grinning\">:grinning:</span> it must be exciting!</p>\n<p>Anyway, nice to meet you all!</p>",
