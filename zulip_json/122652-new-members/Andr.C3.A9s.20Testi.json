This year I was on the Rust Latam conf at Montevideo, and my interest in rust grew a lot. Lately, I have been working on a personal compiler project, wrote a parser in nom 5.0 with WASM as backend. I gained a lot of experience with this project, but want to improve my Rust skills even more. My area of interest is WASM and systems programming, but It's not exclusive, I could help with anything, since I really like this project and community, and want to collaborate with you.</p>",
