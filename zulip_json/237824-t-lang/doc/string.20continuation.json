The behavior of <code>\\</code> at the end of a string line has surprising behavior in that it consumes <em>all</em> whitespace. This is different from other languages like Python where it will only consume a single line.  It is not clear if this was intended, since the reference was explicitly written to say it is only a single line, and the rustc tests only check for a single line.</p>\n<p>It has been this way since it was introduced about 10 years ago: <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/df9cf0be9b898bc3432d444826ff05d6d0e22f97\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/df9cf0be9b898bc3432d444826ff05d6d0e22f97</a></p>\n<p>The question is, should the reference be changed to document how it actually works?  (I think the answer is yes.)  Is anyone else surprised by this?</p>",
