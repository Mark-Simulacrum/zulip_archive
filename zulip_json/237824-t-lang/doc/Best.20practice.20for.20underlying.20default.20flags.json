This feels like something that should be specified in the docs at some point. Id love to do a pull request for this but was wondering if there was a nice example for how these defaults should be outlined and properly written (pull request somewhere?).</p>",

But in general, I'd agree that we should always document what flags we use for things like that.</p>",
