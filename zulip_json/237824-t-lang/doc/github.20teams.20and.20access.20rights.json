To be clear, the lead/member distinction is a bit fuzzy (with some context in <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/team/pull/307\">https://github.com/rust-lang/team/pull/307</a>), as there wasn't much discussion at the time (nobody asked me to be lead).  </p>\n<p>The permission issue is that I can't merge my own PRs (I can merge other PRs).  And that's a bigger question of whether or not I <em>should</em>.  If my PRs can get merged by other people within a reasonable amount of time, it doesn't matter.  But if it takes weeks or months for small changes, that's frustrating and demotivating.  Sometimes, I feel like it would make sense for me to just merge trivial changes like <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/reference/pull/811\">https://github.com/rust-lang/reference/pull/811</a>.   I have other PRs open, which <em>I</em> think are correct, but should I be allowed to just merge them?</p>\n<p>It won't help to sync the team with GitHub.  I already have write access.  The issue is that the repo is configured with branch protections, and \"require reviewer\", and GitHub won't allow you to approve your own PR.  Someone with admin access would need to remove those restrictions, or we should switch to bors.  I would kinda prefer bors, but I don't feel strongly about it.</p>",
