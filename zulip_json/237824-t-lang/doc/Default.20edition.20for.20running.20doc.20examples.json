There has been some confusion about the edition to be used by default.</p>\n<p>As far as I know, 2015 is considered the default edition and all examples should be run using this edition. There is a way to annotate examples with a particular edition, but it appears only 6 out of the ~700 examples we are running make use of it. And 4 of them actually specify the 2015 edition, which made me think we should be using 2021 by default. So this is not clear to me.</p>\n<p>For instance, the first example in <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/items/functions.html#async-functions\">the async functions section from the reference</a> will run okay in 2018 or later but fail if using the 2015 edition. But this <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/fn/closures/closure_examples/iter_any.html\">runnable example in RBE</a> will only compile with 2015.</p>\n<p>So one of those examples needs an annotation, right?</p>",
