I ask because I think the <code>int_roundings</code> feature is likely uncontroversial (minus the one discussion in the tracking issue), but unquestionably needs more time to let the inherent-over-trait method resolution settle by users upgrading <code>num-integer</code>. Is is possible to prospectively stabilize these in say, 1.59 (released 2022-02-24), or does this actually have to wait until 1.59 hits nightly? Asking both from a technical (does the attribute support this) and logistical (can/should we do this) perspective.</p>",
