Apologies if this isn't the right place, but I wasn't sure asking questions on <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/43596\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/43596</a> would be appropriate. My company is starting to use Rust in production, and we have a very similar use  case to what's described on that issue (threads with disparate tasks, and we want OOM in one thread to not tear down the whole process). If it's currently stalled out, is there a way we could contribute to moving that implementation forward, either with programmer time or monetarily?</p>",
