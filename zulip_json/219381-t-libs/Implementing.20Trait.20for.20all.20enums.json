Can anyone give me any pointers?</p>\n<p>I don't have much context for how these parts of <code>rustc</code> work, but from grepping around <code>rustc_interface</code>, it looks like the simplest way to go may be to teach the macro expander (in <code>rustc_expand</code>) that it should run a derive macro which only exists for the purposes of rustc and isn't exposed anywhere outside the compiler, even though no derive macro is written on the type?</p>\n<p>I also thought about having <code>rustc_ast_lowering</code> just pop out a second <code>Item</code> as a side-effect of lowering <code>enum</code>s, but it looks like that code strongly assumes that one <code>Item</code> is lowered to exactly one <code>Item</code> (which is very reasonable!)</p>\n<p>Is there an obviously better approach? Or any other prior art anyone can think of? I can only think of traits which are blanket impl'd (e.g. <code>Any</code>) but <code>enum</code>s AFAIK don't have properties which would allow a blanket impl to target them, or traits which are impl'd on a finite known set of types (e.g. <code>ops::Add</code> for <code>u*</code> types), and not traits which are auto-impl'd for a subset of user-defined types...</p>",
