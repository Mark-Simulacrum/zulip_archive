It's weird to construct a non-map using a map-generating syntax, and even though it's possible for us to give it a meaning, it's more likely to be a typo or bug</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If we called it <code>map!</code> or similar I'd agree, but if it's called <code>collect!</code>, it seems more reasonable for that to work.</p>",
