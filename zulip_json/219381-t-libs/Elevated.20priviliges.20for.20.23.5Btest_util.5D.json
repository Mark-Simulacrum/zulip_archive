When projects get larger it often makes sense to introduce utility functions for your tests that are shared between unit tests of different modules.</p>\n<p>A problem with those test utils is that they lose the elevated privileges that would e.g. allow you to call a constructor with private fields. To solve this you could make the respective fields <code>pub(crate)</code> but that would leak beyond just a test use case.</p>\n<p>I was going to propose a new proc_macro <code>#[test_util]</code> that would elevate privileges of such utility functions, but I am unsure where to start. Should I make a full-fledged RFC for this?</p>",
