But I'd like to work towards getting a subset of the APIs under <code>proc_macro_span</code> stabilized <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54725#issuecomment-813648911\">as I've mentioned under the corresponding RFC</a>.</p>\n<p>The first step seems to be to start separating out APIs under a new feature flag. So far I've set up a branch which includes a change to <a href=\"https://github.com/udoprog/rust/commit/proc-macro-line-column\">move these three items under a new feature flag tentatively named <code>proc_macro_line_column</code></a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/alexcrichton/proc-macro2/blob/master/build.rs\">The way proc-macro2 handles unstable APIs</a> does make this a bit more involved, so I'd like to ask here for guidance in how I can champion moving forward with this change. Given the provenance of the crate It seems appropriate to coordinate this as much as possible.</p>\n<p>In particular I'm interested in <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"119235\">@David Tolnay</span>'s opinion, since they seem to be the person currently most involved with the proc-macro2 crate right now.</p>\n<p>So how would I go about this?</p>",
