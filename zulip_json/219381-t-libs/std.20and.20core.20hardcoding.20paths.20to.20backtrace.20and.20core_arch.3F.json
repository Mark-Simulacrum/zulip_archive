Every crate needs to depend on libcore as it defines a whole lot of essential lang items (without which even something as simple as taking a function argument fails), thus corearch needs to be compiled as part of libcore to be able to export it from libcore. It can't be a regular dependency. Libbacktrace needs libstd for reading files containing the debuginfo, but libstd uses libbacktrace itself, so both need to be compiled together.</p>",
