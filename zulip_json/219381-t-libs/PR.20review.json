The PR was opened six months ago and has been pending review since June 8. There is a minor conflict that I can resolve if wanted prior to review. David Tolnay and Sergio Benitez (who is not on any teams to my knowledge) ok'd the API, and they're probably the two most knowledgeable people regarding proc macros.</p>",
