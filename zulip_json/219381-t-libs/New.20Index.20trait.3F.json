I think this is possibly due to the fact that while it is nice to have these traits, it introduces unexpected complexity, while basically converting a method call from <code>value.fn(idx)</code> to <code>value[idx]</code>. If you have a really compelling use case it might be worthwhile to bring it up in the comments there</p>",
