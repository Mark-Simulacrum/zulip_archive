Making the language smaller is something that's difficult to achieve in general, so it's worth trying to seize whatever opportunities present themselves. It's also, IME, how people intuitively expect deprecations and editions to interact, which is often countered by the mistaken assumption that this is impossible to achieve via the edition mechanism: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/kmo19k/does_rust_use_editions_to_remove_deprecated/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/kmo19k/does_rust_use_editions_to_remove_deprecated/</a> . So even if this gets rejected, it will be useful to have it on the record that this is a conscious decision rather than a limitation of editions.</p>",
