Could we introduce a new trait, call it Read2 as a total strawman, that has <code>read</code> with the <code>ReadBuf</code> argument, rather than adding a new method to the existing Read trait?</p>\n<p>We could add a default impl: <code>impl&lt;T: Read&gt; Read2 for T</code> which wraps the u8 slice in a ReadBuf, so all existing impls of Read have baseline compatiblity, then change all uses of Read to Read2. The downside is back compat where you have a Read2 object and something expects a Read argument, in which case you hit a slow path and have to zero memory, but this seems no worse than using the default impl of read_buf in the current proposal.</p>",

Add a new <code>Read</code> trait, say <code>ReadIntoReadBuf</code>, with no <code>&amp;'_ mut [u8]</code> API, but a <code>ReadBuf&lt;'_&gt;</code> API.</h3>\n<p>Objective: if one of those two traits is implemented, then it should still be possible to interact with APIs requiring the other trait.</p>\n<p>The gap can be filled with a blanket impl in one direction, and a <code>.compat()</code> adapter in the other. To consider these approaches, let's assume a <code>::user</code>, <code>::provides_read</code>, and <code>::uses_read</code> crates, with <code>::user</code> depending on these other two crates.</p>\n<h4>1.1. <code>impl&lt;R : ?Sized + ReadIntoReadBuf&gt; Read for R {}</code> + <code>.compat()</code> adapter for <code>impl Read -&gt; impl ReadIntoReadBuf</code>.</h4>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>all the impls are optimal, except for the code of the <code>Compat&lt;…&gt;</code> adapter (this is good: it's nice to have the noisy one feature the suboptimal impl).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><code>::provides_read</code> can improve its implementation of <code>Read</code> by replacing it with on of <code>ReadIntoReadBuf</code> instead, without breaking semver</strong> / within a minor bump. If <code>::user</code>, itself, where to have an <code>impl ReadIntoReadBuf</code> requirement, then they're all happy.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><code>::uses_read</code> can't improve its logic to take advantage of the new <code>ReadIntoReadBuf</code>, at least not for the already existing APIs</strong>. It will need to either add new APIs itself (<code>stuff</code> -&gt; <code>stuff_read_buf</code>), or to perform a major breaking change. If the major change path is taken, and <code>::user</code> wants to use it, while waiting for <code>::provides_read</code> to catch up, they'll have to temporarily append those <code>.compat()</code> adapters.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2. <code>impl&lt;R : ?Sized + Read&gt; ReadIntoReadBuf for R {}</code> + <code>.compat()</code> adapter for <code>impl ReadIntoReadBuf -&gt; impl Read</code>.</h4>\n<p>Pros/Cons are swapped <em>w.r.t.</em> the previous situation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>::uses_read</code> can now say that its APIs expects an <code>impl ReadIntoReadBuf</code>, and not require a major version bump. But if <code>::provides_read</code> now wants to provide a smarter <code>ReadIntoReadBuf</code> implementation for its type, it will have to let go of the original <code>Read</code> impl because of coherence, and thus so doing would require a major version bump. And, again, <code>::user</code> were to use an updated <code>::provides_read</code>, while waiting for <code>::uses_read</code> to catch up, they'd still need to use <code>.compat()</code> adapters.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The blanket impl provides a <em>silent</em> suboptimal implementation of <code>ReadIntoReadBuf</code>, whereas the noisy <code>.compat()</code> would just be featuring a true no-op compatibility layer for a suboptimal consumer.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Among these two declinations, I think I personally would lean towards <code>1.1</code></p>\n<p>General takeway of <code>1.</code>: requires a new trait (and thus a new name!), and would lead to sometimes requiring major version bumps and/or <code>.compat()</code> wrappers. On top of a deprecated trait lying around.</p>\n<h3>2. Add a new <code>read_buf()</code> method to <code>Read</code>, with a default dummy impl</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The default \"dummy\" (zero-filling) impl is needed for retro-compat / to be able to make the method be a default one;</li>\n<li>This is the approach suggested by the RFC</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No new trait</li>\n<li>Everybody is compatible with everybody, any of <code>::uses_read</code> or <code>::provides_read</code> can improve their stuff on their own end, without breaking the other side (it will just lead to a situation where the improved implementation won't be used, as it happened with <code>.compat()</code> which made that explicit, but at the cost of requiring it / of otherwise breaking code). Once both ends provide their improved implementations, <code>::user</code> suddenly benefits from a performance boost, and all happening within \"transparent\" minor bumps.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>People explicitly overriding <code>read_buf</code> (on top of potentially forgetting to do so!) would still be required to provide an explicit body for <code>fn read()</code>, since it's a mandatory method. Not that big of a deal, but it does leave an after-taste of not-totally-polished design that doesn't suit stdlib-quality APIs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I personally have to admit that this doesn't look as bad as <code>1.</code>'s transitioning phase, even if long-term it would be worse <strong>if no palliative measures were applied</strong>. Good news is, we could always provide such measures in the interim to still have a nice mid-to-long-term situation <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span> </p>\n<h3>2.1. Palliative measures (potentially requiring new features and/or new lints) for the <code>fn read(…)…; fn read_buf(…) … { … }</code></h3>\n<p>Key idea: <strong>make <code>fn read (…) { … }</code> default as well by delegating to <code>read_buf</code>. But</strong> since <code>read_buf()</code>'s default impl already delegates to <code>read(…)</code>, <strong>people could \"miswrite\" an <code>impl Read</code> and \"forget\" to write any methods, <em>with the compiler not saying anything</em>, and leading to infinite recursions at runtime</strong></p>\n<p>Solution: make the compiler \"say a thing\" when that happens. A basic implementation would be to make <code>Read</code> be a <code>#[lang]</code> item, and hardcode / special-case that impl.</p>\n<p>A nicer way would be to provide a more general tool for this pattern, which technically applies to other traits as well (<em>e.g.</em>, <code>PartialEq::{eq, ne}</code>):</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">trait</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Read</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"k\">fn</span> <span class=\"nf\">read</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">&amp;</span><span class=\"k\">mut</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">self</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">buf</span>: <span class=\"kp\">&amp;</span><span class=\"nc\">mut</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"kt\">u8</span><span class=\"p\">])</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>-&gt; <span class=\"nb\">Result</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"kt\">usize</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"cp\">#![requires(fn read_buf)]</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"bp\">self</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">read_buf</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">ReadBuf</span>::<span class=\"n\">new</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">buf</span><span class=\"p\">)).</span><span class=\"n\">map</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">|</span><span class=\"p\">()</span><span class=\"o\">|</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">buf</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">filled</span><span class=\"p\">().</span><span class=\"n\">len</span><span class=\"p\">())</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"k\">fn</span> <span class=\"nf\">read_buf</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">&amp;</span><span class=\"k\">mut</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">self</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">buf</span>: <span class=\"nc\">ReadBuf</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;'</span><span class=\"nb\">_</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>-&gt; <span class=\"nb\">Result</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"p\">()</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"cp\">#![requires(fn read)]</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"bp\">self</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">read</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">buf</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">initialize_unfilled</span><span class=\"p\">()).</span><span class=\"n\">map</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">|</span><span class=\"n\">n</span><span class=\"o\">|</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">buf</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">add_filled</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">n</span><span class=\"p\">))</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>so that</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">impl</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Read</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">for</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">MyThing</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{}</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>would cause:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Bash Session\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"go\">Error: cycle detected when resolving the default implementations requirements.</span>\n<span class=\"go\">info = `fn read_buf` requires `fn read`, which requires `fn read_buf`, completing the cycle.</span>\n<span class=\"go\">note = you may need to provide an explicit implementation of one of these methods</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>A hacky way would be to make the <code>infinite_recursion</code> smart enough to detect this problem and lint against it; although the error message wouldn't look great</p>\n</div></div>",
