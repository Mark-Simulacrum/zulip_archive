This is a change from the older proposal which was to have a dedicated syntax of <code>&amp;raw</code>. <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72279#issuecomment-631142100\">You can read more about the reasons for this change here</a>, but in today's meeting, we realized that this does then become kind of \"libs surface area\", so I wanted to make you all aware of the proposal. These macros would be unstable for now but I expect we would want to move towards stability.</p>",
