These intrinsics match the underlying wasm instructions, or build slightly upon them for type-friendliness; their structure is pretty much determined by wasm.</li>\n<li>Regarding syntax, thinking about it, I think it'd be fine to stabilize the current syntax as-is, and that doesn't <em>stop</em> us from adding a potentially friendlier syntax for the const generic arguments <em>later</em>.</li>\n</ul>",
