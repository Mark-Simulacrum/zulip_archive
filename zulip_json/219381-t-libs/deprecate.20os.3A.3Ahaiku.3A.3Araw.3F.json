But shortly after that RFC was implemented someone added haiku support, and I think they simply didn't realize that they shouldn't be adding a raw module. the haiku-related items all appear to be exposed by the libc crate. would it be worth submitting a PR to deprecate that module and bring it in line with all the others?</p>",
