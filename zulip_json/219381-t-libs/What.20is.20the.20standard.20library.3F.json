I'm curious to hear all the perspectives in a bit more detail. Overall there seems to be some consensus that e.g. 'arrayvec' should be in std (or core), while e.g. http parsing should not be. But many things fall in the gray area inbetween; for example mpmc channels. I'm curious to find the line between those and maybe define it a bit more clearly, if we can.</p>\n<p>→ Can y'all give examples of where this border is for you?

It \"fits\" in the sense that it feels like it's within the scope of things std does and it's limited enough that there doesn't (atm) look like stabilizing  the API would be a problem.
