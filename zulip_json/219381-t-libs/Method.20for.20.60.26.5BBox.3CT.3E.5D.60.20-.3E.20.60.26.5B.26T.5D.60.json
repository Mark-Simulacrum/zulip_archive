I can go from <code>Vec&lt;Box&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> to <code>&amp;[Box&lt;T&gt;]</code>, but I can't replace the inner <code>Box</code> with an <code>&amp;</code> without copying or going through iterators. Given that <code>Box</code> and <code>&amp;</code> have the same type layout, I'd like to propose adding a method to do this to the stdlib. Thoughts?</p>",
