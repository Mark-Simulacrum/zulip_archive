I'm technically a maintainer on <code>libm</code>, but I'm the junor-most maintainer. There's a PR to fix some bugs which are affecting the Debian folks, but there's some unrelated test errors as well. The normal leads of the project are usually too busy to even give advice on this sort of thing, so can someone please have a look and give an opinion about what's going on and how to proceed?</p>",
