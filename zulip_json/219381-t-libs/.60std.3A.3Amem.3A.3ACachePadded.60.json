I.e. the region tagged by the LL command is.  So what you perfectly would want to is a alignment of the max of the cache line size and the \"exclusive reservation granularity\"  as size. (<em>Through I would <strong>guess</strong> that there is no (relevant?) target which has a \"exclusive reservation granularity\" larger then the cache line size</em>).</p>\n<p>Furthermore targets might always treat cache lines in pairs/triples/etc. For example the crossbeam documentation states that Intel processors do so from a certain generation on which is why they use <code>128</code> instead of <code>64</code> for the alignment.</p>\n<p>Which is I guess why C++ called it <code>hardware_destructive_interference_size</code> and not cache line size <span aria-label=\"wink\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f609\" role=\"img\" title=\"wink\">:wink:</span>.</p>\n<p>So what I think would make most sense:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>introduce an alias similar <code>hardware_destructive_interference_size</code> which can be used in <code>#[repr(align(&lt;here&gt;))]</code>.   In difference to <code>crossbeam</code> this can be much more fine grained e.g. default to the same values as used in crossbeam   but potential other (smaller) values if compiled with <code>target-cpu=native</code> (or similar).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>as something like <code>CachePadded</code> is the most simple (and often best/only) solution to prevent interference between  e.g. atomics having it in <code>core</code> wouldn't be bad. Note that while it most times is used with atomics there are a view  non atomic use cases, so it makes sense to place it in <code>core::mem</code> (as well as <code>std::mem</code>).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In difference to the destructive version I have no idea how the constructive version could be used. If you prefer constructive interference you already place things as close together as possible. So my best idea would be something like \"fail compilation<br>\nif size_of::&lt;(a,b)&gt;() &gt; constructive_interference_size\". Or try using packed repr if it's bigger or similar things. So I think adding this should probably be a separate discussion, maybe?</p>",
