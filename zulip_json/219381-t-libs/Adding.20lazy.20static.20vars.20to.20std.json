Lazily initialised static variables are one of the most common patterns in Rust. <code>lazy_static</code>, <code>lazycell</code> and <code>once_cell</code> combined have about 37 million downloads on <a href=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a>; which makes them the more popular than <code>rand</code>. Looking at the code for all of these implementations  are all relatively straightforward and small, so it seems like it wouldn't have a substantial impact on the std library while providing huge amount of utility.</p>\n<p>Cc <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"133169\">@matklad</span></p>",
