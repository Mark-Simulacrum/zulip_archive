As part of that, I implemented some missing functionality that I needed in <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/packed_simd/pull/286\">packed_simd #286</a>. However, looking at the repo, it looks like there has been zero (code) activity since Oct 28, 2019. Has there been any discussion of how/when maintenance of this project will take place? I'd love to be able to get my PR merged and released as it's a pretty simple non-breaking change that adds wanted/missing functionality. Alternatively I might end up publishing my own version until the official one is maintained and can have another release again</p>",
