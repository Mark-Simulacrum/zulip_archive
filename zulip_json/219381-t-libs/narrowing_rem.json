I was just wondering if there is any interest in the <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/72762\"><code>narrowing_rem</code></a> issue that was created a while back.

Presumably not, but you never know. Regardless, this is something that could definitely be done in <code>num</code>, and is probably worth a pull request there. For better or for worse, that's probably not something I'll do, as I don't personally use that crate for anything.</p>",
