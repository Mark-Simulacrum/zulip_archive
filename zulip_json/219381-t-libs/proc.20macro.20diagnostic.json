I believe it's been around for long enough in its current form on nightly to be stabilized. Warnings should imo be excluded for now because of the unresolved issue regarding <code>#[allow]</code>ing them. The <code>Level</code> enum is already non-exhaustive, so gating the <code>Warning</code> variant wouldn't cause any forward-compatibility concerns.</p>",
