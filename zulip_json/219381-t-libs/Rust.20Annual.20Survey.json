To that end, I've created <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@ryanlevick/rJFqnDV6O\">a document</a> that outlines the \"high-level\" questions, we'd love to get answers to from survey data. This document is not meant as a place to discuss the survey question themselves but rather the questions we hope the survey data will help us answer. <strong>Please feel free to give it a read and leave any comments on what to add, remove, or improve.</strong> <br>\nIf you would like to participate in the effort, stop by <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"294169\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/294169-t-community.2Frust-survey-2021\">#t-community/rust-survey-2021</a></p>",
