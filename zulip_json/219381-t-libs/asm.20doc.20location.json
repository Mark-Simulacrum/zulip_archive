By looking at the stabilization PR I see that the docs were split between the reference and rust-by-example, but I think that's going to be non-obvious to users who will probably think of checking the stdlib docs first as the \"canonical\" location for API documentation. I know that <code>asm!</code> is more language-feature-adjacent than many stdlib items, but as precedence the stdlib API docs also contain material on format strings (<a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/index.html\">https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/index.html</a>), which, like <code>asm!</code>, are essentially a language-level DSL. At the very least the page for <code>core::arch::asm</code> should link to where the <code>asm!</code> docs are right now (ideally as a beta backport), and I'd suggest that at some point in the future that page should contain docs that are useful for users (as opposed to the reference, which contains docs that are useful for implementors, or rust-by-example, which contain docs that are useful for learners)</p>",
