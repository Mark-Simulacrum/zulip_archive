Like the rest of the rust repo, you should use the configuration from here for the best results: <a href=\"https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/building/suggested.html#configuring-rust-analyzer-for-rustc\">https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/building/suggested.html#configuring-rust-analyzer-for-rustc</a></p>\n<p>If you have any other issues, the known issues in r-a for the rust repo are tracked here, please let us know about any more that you find :)<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues/8915\">https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues/8915</a></p>\n<p>As for the cause, since rust analyzer previously hard-coded the test cfg to always be true in cargo crates, it could not see the contents of libcore, which has a <code>#![cfg(not(test))]</code>. This broke navigation and completion for items in libstd and libcore, but only when they were being accessed from a cargo workspace context (i.e. in the rust repo only). I added a config setting disabling this behaviour, which defaults to unsetting the test cfg on crates called \"core\".</p>",
