Is someone interested in looking at the generated docs to make sure they look appropriate? I'd also be interested in feedback on the feature itself, since I expect the standard library to be one of the biggest users.</p>\n<p>It needs a rebase for now, but afterwards I can run a <code>try</code> build so you can run <code>x.py doc --stage 0</code> without having to build rustdoc from source</p>",
