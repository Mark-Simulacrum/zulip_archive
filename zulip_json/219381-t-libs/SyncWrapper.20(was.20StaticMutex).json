I’ve been referred to this channel by <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/71529#issuecomment-629211792\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/71529#issuecomment-629211792</a>: in earlier discussions in other places we came across the need to enlist the compiler’s help in proving the absence of concurrency. This works by ensuring that an object can only be accessed through exclusive references, thereby making anything that is <code>Send</code> also <code>Sync</code> (because synchronization is statically ensured).</p>\n<p>In the PR above I therefore proposed StaticMutex as the name, but as <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"120791\">@RalfJ</span> pointed out this has the wrong connotations. So which way do we want to go with this? <code>SyncWrapper</code> probably is the most directly linked to the intended usage, <code>Unshare</code> has been proposed as a higher-level description of the structure’s facilities. I’m fine either way, so what do you people here think?</p>",
