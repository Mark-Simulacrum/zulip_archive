Two weeks ago <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75065\">this PR</a> popped up, which changed the \"µs\" in the <code>Debug</code> impl of <code>Duration</code> to \"us\".  Some people are strongly against removing the non-ASCII unicode char (as µs is correct) while others are strongly in favor of keeping the output ASCII only to maximize compatibility.</p>\n<p>In the PR, someone brought up that there should be a <strong>general decision</strong> on the use of non-ASCII chars in the standard library's <code>Debug</code> and <code>Display</code> impls. I agree with that, hence this thread. (Just to be clear: we are not talking about cases where non-ASCII unicode data already exists, like with <code>String</code>. This is just about the cases where non-ASCII chars are \"hardcoded\" in std.)</p>\n<p>What do you think? Also: should we discuss this in an issue with FCP in the end?</p>",
