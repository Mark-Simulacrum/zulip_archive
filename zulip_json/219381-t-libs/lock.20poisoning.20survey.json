It's a fairly popular blog post on how to deal with errors in programming. Rust's error handling model is very close to the conclusion of that blog post: statically checked \"recoverable errors\" and abandonment in case of bugs. Particularly the later part is interesting in regards to poisoning:</p>\n<p>The author says that the correct response to a bug is to tear down the current process as everything the buggy code might have touched should be considered tainted. Rust's \"abandonment\" model, panics, only tears down the current thread, which is a lot less isolated than processes. But that's whats poisoning helps with: to better isolate a buggy (panicked) thread. </p>\n<p>So what I'm getting at: from my understanding, removing poisoning would steer Rust a bit further from the \"clean abandonment\" model in that blog post.</p>",

As in: everything that buggy code might have influenced should be considered invalid. Within reason of course. If your webserver handles each request individually and in an isolated fashion (as it should usually be the case), then just panicking for that one request and responding 5xx, but keeping the server running is perfectly reasonable. And I think it doesn't conflict with the blog article I posted: \"architect your system so that the whole remains functional even when individual pieces fail\". </p>\n<p>And well, one way that \"isolation of threads\" is violated is via sharing data via mutexes. If one thread of a webserver panics while holding a global lock, then it might be worth thinking about whether the whole server should stop.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I  want to argue that deadlocking on panic is good.<br>\nTwo (and a half) arguments: 1) this is how it works in \"other languages\", and it's an unsurprising behavior. You usually have something like</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>mutex.lock()\ndo_stuff()  // this might throw an exception/panic/terminate the thread/whatever\nmutex.unlock()\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Mimicking that is at least \"not a regression\" [coming from other languages]<br>\nAlso note that this even happens in languages that use exceptions as a control flow, and where such \"panics\" are much more common.</p>\n<p>2) if the non-poisoning API is more ergonomic (due to the lack of <code>.unwrap()</code>s), then people who don't really think about intricacies of concurrency and poisoning (i.e., me) would tend to use this \"simpler\" API over the poisoning one (\"because they don't need this advanced feature\" or similar).<br>\nWhen they switch from the poisoning locks to non-poisoning, release-on-panic locks, their programs' behavior change from \"stop doing anything useful upon a panic\" to \"silently operate on corrupted data upon a panic\" (which is really really bad!!). This behavior, however, is not changed, if they switch to stay-locked-on-panic locks - the program continues to \"not do anything useful\", just in a slightly different shape now.<br>\nSo, again, deadlocking on panic is \"not a regression\" [coming from naive use of current <code>std</code> locks that doesn't handle poisoning]</p>\n<p>3) I don't even think the distinction between \"genuine deadlock\" [that arose because you failed to maintain an invariant] vs \"panic-induced deadlock\" [that arouse because you failed to restore invariant upon a panic, that you did handle, but only partially] is meaningful. It is probably nice during development, but not so much in production. And, if you really care about the two - maybe poisoning locks is what you really want here?..</p>",

Consider the case of an AlwaysEvenInteger, which has a method where it's updated by two successive <code>*x = x.checked_add(1).unwrap()</code>. If one of them triggers overflow, It could be left in an \"inconsistent\" state because it didn't get to execute the 2nd addition.</p>\n<p>That said personally I've never wanted lock poisoning behavior, and largely agree with <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"243558\">@Steven Fackler</span>'s comments — IME the vast majority of the time stuff is fine, and the poisoning behavior is undesirable and leads to meaningfully less robust software.</p>\n<p>I'll also note that there's a nontrivial cost associated with implementing lock poisoning (admittedly it's been reduced somewhat recently), which often pushes people towards custom solutions regardless, which IMO isn't a great situation.</p>",

My own experience with these types is that they seem like they could be really useful traits, but the invariants they manage are too spongy for the current system to really protect, and the cases when you need them are uncommon enough that a lot of libraries ignore them. As an auto-trait system they don't seem to pull their weight.</p>",

        "content": "<p>My 2ct's on this: I think the ability to detect and <strong>handle</strong> poisoning is very import for synchronization primitives which protect shared memory which is shared <strong>between different processes</strong>. If another process crashed, the shared state might be in inconsistent state, and something needs to clean it up. Crashing the local process is not the answer here, because the corrupted shared memory might still stay around. </p>\n<p>However for intra-process Mutexes I never found it useful to handle poisoned Mutexes. Most of the code I've written using Mutexes assumes that code executed while holding the lock never panics. If it does, something is very wrong, and the shared state might again not be in any well-defined and consistent state. Like with any kind of memory corruption or cache poisoning, continuing to run from there is dangerous. The current poisoning API allows to detect and fix the situation. However since it's not an expected state, I many people (including me) will skip handling it. And even if they do it might be barely tested and still have issues.<br>\nThat's why I'm not opposed to having a default behavior which panics again when trying to access such a log.</p>",
