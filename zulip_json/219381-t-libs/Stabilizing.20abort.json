But another natural implementation would have been to send the error payload through the unwinding mechanism, and to pattern-match against an attempt to downcast such payload: so that's the use case of <code>thread::unwind(Some(…))</code> I have in mind <span aria-label=\"sweat smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f605\" role=\"img\" title=\"sweat smile\">:sweat_smile:</span></p>",
