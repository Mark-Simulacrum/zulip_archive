I have a sketch here of an API which I think is substantially improved in a few important ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is not parameterized by a weird lifetime.</li>\n<li>It does not have the searcher own the haystack, so algorithms can possibly mutate the haystack while searching it</li>\n<li>It allows haystacks of types other than <code>str</code> (intended to be slices, primarily)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here's a gist:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/rust-play/6f4932a58832875b81e37306cf6f16cd\">https://gist.github.com/rust-play/6f4932a58832875b81e37306cf6f16cd</a></p>\n<p>It would take something like an MCP to actually drive this into std, resolve many questions that are definitely outstanding and even raised by this new API, and eventually toward stabilization, but maybe there's a group that could be interested in this, and we could try something like an MCP process for libs for this? Posting here to solicit for interest.</p>",
