I have a use-case that would greatly benefit from some form of \"inheritable\" thread-local storage; that is, storage that's initialized by the <em>spawning</em> thread (perhaps simply a clone of its own value), at the time the new thread is spawned similar to <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/16/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/InheritableThreadLocal.html\"><code>java.lang.InheritableThreadLocal</code></a> (<a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US6820261B1/en\">patent</a> expired 2019).</p>\n<p>I believe that this must necessarily be implemented in spawning code, e.g. in <code>std::thread::Builder::spawn</code>, and indeed I have a working experiment.  I also understand that such a change will require an RFC, especially to settle the user-facing interface—and so I'm seeking feedback before I begin writing one (which will be my first).</p>\n<p>FWIW, my current experiment (to which I'm in no way wedded) stores a slice of keys in a global static (which I currently initialize, via an exposed intiailization function, upon application startup: it would be great to instead find some way to do this via an attribute on the key declaration, but I guess that would require new language features?).  Then, whenever a thread is spawned, the elements of that slice are inherited in two stages: first in the spawning thread (which calls a method on <code>InheritableLocalKey</code> to obtain a <code>FnOnce</code> closure); and then in the spawned thread (which invokes the closure to initialize the TLS):</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span
