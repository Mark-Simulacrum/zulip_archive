And the docs don't even mention that <code>compare_exchange</code> + <code>compare_exchange_weak</code> are supposed to replace it. You have no idea how much time I have spent trying to figure out what the difference is and which one should be used in what case. Let's deprecate it immediately or at least update the docs :/</p>",
