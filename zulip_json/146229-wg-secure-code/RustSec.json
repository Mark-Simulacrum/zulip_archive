We have much better resources. I would write these advisory posts on the \"Inside Rust\" blog if they're meant to be on behalf of the working group. If you want to solicit feedback, I would recommend then posting the link of the blog on other platforms, and direct discussion to discourse or to the Zulip. You can even give people the email address to send feedback &lt;<a href=\"mailto:wg-secure-code.ce41ebc1bb12c5c507d7017f50ca1272.show-sender@streams.zulipchat.com\">wg-secure-code.ce41ebc1bb12c5c507d7017f50ca1272.show-sender@streams.zulipchat.com</a>&gt;.
