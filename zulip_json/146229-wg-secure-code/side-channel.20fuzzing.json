        "content": "<p>Hi everyone,</p>\n<p>I was wondering if anyone has looked into using fuzzing to detect side-channel vulnerabilities, and if there would be any interest in this group in pursuing that? </p>\n<p>The basic idea is to split your fuzzing input into two parts, and run the two input-parts against your program.  The fitness function of the fuzzer is then modified so that, in addition to coverage, it's also trying to maximize the difference in time, memory, and instructions between the two input parts.  The research suggests that this can find real-world timing vulnerabilities.  More information on the research can be found here: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07005\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07005\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07005</a></p>",

DifFuzz, at first glance, also seems limited to timing-based side-channel vulnerabilities (please correct me if I'm wrong), and I can't quite tell why I should use that instead of dudeCT.

        "content": "<p>Then it's somewhat in the lines of what I suspected. I still don't know whether it is limited to timing side-channels or if it could measure anything else. I actually thought about whether it was something to be combined, because finding input for dudeCT that produces the largest t-values could be handy. On the other hand, some crypto algorithms are very straightforward to craft such inputs for, such as comparisons. I'm not familiar with PAPI, but the crate seems to only support (only tested on) Linux of the major platforms. If DifFuzz only supports timing-based side-channels, it would be a shame to limit the fuzzer to only Linux machines (if the crate doesn't work on other major platforms), when the CPU's cycle counter could just as well have been used.</p>\n<p>This would be my first time being involved building something like this, so it's probably best if you just go ahead on the PoC. This way I can follow along and get a more solid understanding of what this project would consist of. I'm still happy to discuss it though.</p>",

It can successfully tell the difference between constant-time and non-constant time functions by fuzzing inputs.     It operates in two steps:</p>\n<p>Step 1. Use a genetic algorithm to find candidate input pairs that look like they might have large differenced in timing (similar to DiffFuzz)<br>\nStep 2. Uses statistics to check t-values to confirm that there is <em>really</em> a difference (similar to DudeCT). </p>\n<p>Right now I'm counting cpu-cycles as my primary measurement.   It should work on all x64 platforms.   Using cpu-cycles is a bit noisy, so I still want to use PAPI behind a feature-flag for linux users.    Please take it for a run and give feedback. There's still lots of cleanup to do in terms of documentation etc etc.</p>",

I made a major pivot in the architecture of the whole thing.  Instead of counting CPU cycles, it now requires that targets be compiled to wasm, and counts individual instructions as it executes the target inside a wasm interpreter.   This has some advantages and disadvantages:</p>\n<p>1. Major advantage is that using wasm makes the fuzzer WAY more accurate.   It is now easily able to pick out side-channel vulnerabilities, and consistently evolves inputs that maximize timing differences. More importantly, there are no more false-positives.  It works exactly as it should, and it works really well. <br>\n2. Major disadvantage is that we now require the targets to compile to wasm.  Targets like ring don't compile to wasm, so we can't fuzz them.  However, I expect this disadvantage to slowly diminish over time as more and more cryptography crates add wasm support. <br>\n3. Bonus: we can now fuzz non-rust code for side-channel vulnerabilities. Go, C, and C++ can all be used with sidefuzz if they can compile to wasm.<br>\nPlease take a look at provide feedback.  The tool has already found it's first side-channel vulnerability, and I will be reporting that to it the relevant crate shortly.</p>",
