        "content": "<p>So the post is going up tomorrow, I'll probably going to post it to Reddit with a comment with RustSec context specifically. My current draft for the comment is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For Rust this pulls data from <a href=\"https://github.com/RustSec/advisory-db\">https://github.com/RustSec/advisory-db</a>, the security advisory database maintained by the <a href=\"https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/wgs/wg-secure-code\">Rust Secure Code WG</a>. This is the same database that powers <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/cargo-audit\"><code>cargo-audit</code></a>.</p>\n<p><strong>What this means for RustSec?</strong></p>\n<p>We're happy to provide the RustSec database in an interchange format, as opposed to a custom format only. However, there are no plans to deprecate the RustSec TOML format, mostly because it's easier for humans to work with. TOML will continue to be the source of truth, with OSV JSON representation being derived from it.</p>\n<p>As usual, if you have discovered a security issue in your code and would like to notify your dependents so they could upgrade to a fixed version, be sure to <a href=\"https://github.com/RustSec/advisory-db\">report it</a>. (If you've just found a memory safety issue and are not sure if it qualifies, get in touch and we'll help you assess the impact).</p>\n<p><strong>Implementation notes</strong></p>\n<p><code>serde_json</code> made generating the JSON a breeze. Moreover, exporting the entire database only takes 200 milliseconds, and most of that time is spent walking git history to get file modification dates (which, as it turned out, is <a href=\"https://github.com/RustSec/rustsec/blob/63f5665eebb886890152bfaaa2d9a1d0cc697885/rustsec/src/repository/git/modification_time.rs#L17\">not as simple as calling a library function</a>).</p>\n<p>Google has kindly sponsored the RustSec/OSV integration work. I'd do it anyway because it's a good idea, but it was nice to have it as a paid 20% project. Normally I work on Rust projects purely in my spare time.</p>\n<p>The code for the export can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/RustSec/rustsec/pull/366\">here</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/Shnatsel/advisory-db/tree/osv\">this</a> is what the exported data looks like.</p>\n</blockquote>",
