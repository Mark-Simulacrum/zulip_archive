The platform should be one that your intended audience frequents, or can be easily directed to<br>\n  B. Not have a prohibitively high entry barrier for participation. In fact I'd advocate for as low entry barrier as possible<br>\n  C. If the opinion you share has already been stated, require as little effort as possible to express your support</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Structure the discussion in a scalable way, meaning:<br>\n  A. Provide a way for discussion participants to talk to each other and come up with new ideas in the course of it<br>\n  B. Avoid requiring people to restate the same point many times if it has already been stated<br>\n  C. Allow following different discussion threads easily and/or skipping certain parts that are not relevant to the aspects of the discussion that you're interested in<br>\n  D. Encourage people to lay out their opinions in a concise fashion (necessary to fulfill the above points)<br>\n  E. Conceal or remove posts or conversation threads that are not constructive</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Email completely fails 1C and 2A. Discourse, Github and Zulip fail 2C, which in turn makes 1B, 1C, 2A and 2B really hard in large discussions. Imagine <a href=\"https://redd.it/gidtpe\">https://redd.it/gidtpe</a> linearized and sorted by date - it's a mess! Platforms like Reddit and Disqus (not to be confused with Discourse) are so much better at 2C thanks to \"every reply starts a thread\" system, and fulfilling 2C enables a great deal of other points in turn. There are also platforms entirely dedicated to decision-making and laying out pros and cons, but almost no-one is familiar with them so the entry barrier is quite high. </p>\n<p>I can understand the reluctance to use an platform that you don't fully control and/or that is perceived as informal (e.g. Facebook) for official decisions, but for pre-RFCs Reddit seems to be the least terrible option that we currently have. So what are the requirements that Reddit does <strong>not</strong> currently meet? Once we have that written down, we'll hopefully find the crux of the disagreement and be able to figure out a better solution.</p>",
