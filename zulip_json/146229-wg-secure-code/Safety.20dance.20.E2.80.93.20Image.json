Because the initial PR to remove all unsafety for 0.22 was done by <a href=\"https://github.com/fintelia\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/fintelia\">https://github.com/fintelia</a>. My role was more of a maintainer hence the fixing PR is co-authored by me and did the impact post mortems. It was afterwards that I was stubborn enough to backport them to 0.21.</p>",
