On the other, it makes some rather strong claims without backing them up - like \"Such issues are very common in third-party Rust libraries.\" and states that Rust is no better at preventing memory safety issues than \"other languages\", which is not a conclusion you can derive from the data presented. The \"Implication to Potential Users\" section is much more correct but almost reads like it contradicts the rest of the paper.</p>",
