I think the sentence you refer to is perhaps a little implicitly worded (in particular, what \"concerns beyond those that the Rust compiler chooses to associate with unsafe Rust\" precisely means. I think we're aiming to say that these are usages of \"unsafe\" that go beyond what the compiler requires the programmer to write; in these examples, there's nothing (even transitively via called functions) which explicitly forces the programmer to consider adding an \"unsafe\" and they chose to do so nonetheless. Your <code>Vec::set_len</code> example seems to be a good example of such a case, indeed (the compiler won't ask you to label that function as unsafe, but you indeed should for deeper reasons).</p>",

We were wondering how often this happens, and also whether we could find cases in which unsafe appears to be used to document concerns other than undefined behaviour (which could be another potential reason for a function being labelled as unsafe without anything in its body that the compiler would otherwise complain about).

I believe that the instances of unsafe traits that we identified and then looked into by hand often appeared to use the feature to specify functional guarantees other than those clearly directly concerning  undefined behaviour. For example, <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.TrustedLen.html\">https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.TrustedLen.html</a> -  in contrast with other usages of \"unsafe\" it (on the surface) appears to be used to document specifications that aren't clearly/only concerned with UB. I think there were some other non-standard-library instances in the dataset too which used unsafe trait to flag certain expected postconditions, but I'd need to check.</p>\n<p>Of course, there could be client code (of the trait) which depends on these guarantees in arbitrary ways including to prevent undefined behaviour in some unsafe code somewhere (and maybe there even is such code elsewhere in the standard library; I guess this is what makes <code>TrustedLen</code> an unsafe trait?), but that at least also <em>could</em> be the case for any functional properties. In that sense, it seemed to us that there was less clarity on when a trait should be marked as unsafe or not. In practice, we also observed in the study that unsafe traits are used quite rarely, which we speculated could also be for this reason.</p>",

It seems that this would only have advantages; I'm making clear to client code that this property can be relied upon (as opposed to something which is meant to be the case but cannot be relied upon... I'm not sure when I would want to say that). In that sense, it seems hard to decide based on the property, essentially because it's how the <em>clients</em> of this code will want eventually to use and depend on it which determines whether adding unsafe will be useful/necessary or not.</p>",
