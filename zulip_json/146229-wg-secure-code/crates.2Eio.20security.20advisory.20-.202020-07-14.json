This means that in theory, an attacker could observe enough random values to determine the internal state of the random number generator, and use this information to determine previously created API keys up to the last database server reboot.</p>\n<p>As part of the investigation for this, we also found that API keys were being stored in plain text.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Oh my...</p>",
