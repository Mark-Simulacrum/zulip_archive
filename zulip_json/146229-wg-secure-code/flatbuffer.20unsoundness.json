They are all more or less the same kind of bug: semi-internal helper functions for serializing/deserializing doing unsound pointer arithmetic/transmutes. However they are spread out over a bunch of different functions/traits in different parts of the library. Should I file a single report for all of them, or does it make more sense to make individual reports for each of them?</p>\n<p>I am not sure if they are all be easily fixable, so some of them might be open for a while.</p>",
