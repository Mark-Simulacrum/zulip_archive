Reports of malicious packages are easily teh <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/1\">#1</a> source of reports to <a href=\"mailto:security@python.org\">security@python.org</a>. They're also a pain to manually moderate, they require a PyPI admin to review the package and its author for _intent_, and because the remediation action is removing the package, this is a privileged action that can't be widely delegated.</p>\n<p>At this point I'm pretty convinced of the merits of Go's solution: URLs seem to be harder to typo-squat (they're usually copy pasted instead of manually typed) and also it outsources the problem of moderation to github or whoever else, freeing up the mostly-volunteer OSS team to do other things.</p>\n<p>There may be other solutions to this problem than Go's, but I believe strongly that you need a structural change to packaging to really solve this.</p>",
