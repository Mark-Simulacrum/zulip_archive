I was browsing recent <a href=\"https://rustsec.org/advisories/\">RustSec advisories</a> and noticed a couple \"crate rename\" advisories, e.g. <a href=\"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0025.html\">RUSTSEC-2021-0025</a>. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I am guessing the reason these advisories exist is to prevent dependency confusion attacks as was discussed <a href=\"https://users.rust-lang.org/t/dependency-confusion-attack-may-be-applicable-to-alternative-registries/55389\">here</a>. If that's the case, I'd suggest adding a sentence or two to these types of advisories about why they exist and what a user of these crates can do about it.</p>",
