In other words, the standard library is sometimes imposing a dichotomy of \"avoid <code>unsafe</code>\" vs \"avoid panics.\" Later we sometimes end up adding non-panicking versions of the APIs, resulting in API bloat. Perhaps we need a new idiom for communicating API misuse that avoids panics but is more ergonomic than using <code>Result</code> currently is.</p>",
