RustSec only stores <code>yanked = true</code>, while OSV expects a timestamp as well (or at least a date).<br>\nWe cannot reliably obtain the yank time from git history; heuristics are possible but will not be 100% reliable.<br>\nI see two ways to resolve this: either make the date on the OSV's equivalent of <code>yanked</code> optional, or add explicit withdrawal dates to RustSec format _and_ make them mandatory if <code>yanked = true</code>.</p>\n<p>OSV's point of view is that the withdrawal date is an important part of the advisory lifecycle, and should be explicitly recorded. My point of view is that interaction with withdrawn advisories should be rare, and if anyone really cares they can look up the revision history in git. OSV also has a unified revision history planned, but is not implemented yet.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"130046\">@Alex Gaynor</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"132721\">@Tony Arcieri</span> should we add a mandatory field for the yank date, or should I push for OSV making the yank timestamp optional?</p>",
