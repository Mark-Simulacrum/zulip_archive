We identified three bug patterns that are prevalent in unsafe Rust, devised two static analysis algorithms for the detection, and ran an ecosystem-scale analysis. Rudra identified 264 new memory safety bugs which got 78 CVE IDs - including 2 CVE-assigned bugs in the Rust standard library.</p>\n<p>The implementation, pre-print version of the paper, and the list of bugs are now public:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/sslab-gatech/Rudra\">https://github.com/sslab-gatech/Rudra</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/sslab-gatech/Rudra-PoC\">https://github.com/sslab-gatech/Rudra-PoC</a></p>",
