Kind of reminds me of my proposal to tie each unsafe block to a cargo feature: <a href=\"https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/crate-capability-lists/8933/2\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/crate-capability-lists/8933/2\">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/crate-capability-lists/8933/2</a></p>",
