I believe the best first step is filing an issue on the upstream repository; we will see how it goes from there.<br>\n(Background: Simply filing an advisory without notifying the maintainers leads to maintainer burnout and hurts the project and the dependent ecosystem in the long run; but the users also need to be notified in case the upstream refuses to resolve the issue. We are currently re-evaluating the way we approach unfixed vulnerabilities to find a better balance between these two concerns)</p>",
