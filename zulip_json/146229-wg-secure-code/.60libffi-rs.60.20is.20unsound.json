I mentioned this in the Rust community Discord and was told I should post here.</p>\n<p>The <code>libffi</code> crate, which provides bindings to the <a href=\"https://sourceware.org/libffi/\">libffi</a> library, is unsound with respect to <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code>, in that it, through only safe APIs, erases all auto traits on closures.<br>\nIt also erases the mutability required to call them, in that you can call a <code>ClosureMutN</code> via shared references.</p>",
