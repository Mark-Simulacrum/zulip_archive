Also, maybe the chance is smaller of finding a function pointer in the vicinity, in contrast to stack overflow where there's a return address not far away. This would be a band-aid for the lack of stack-smashing protection at best though.</li>\n<li>The stack probing mentioned is for stack <em>clash</em> mitigation, right?</li>\n<li>The sanitizer flag sounds promising, though chiefly combined with the \"safe-stack\" sanitizer which fwict is intended for use in release builds. There's no support for this in rustc, even on nightly, correct?</li>\n<li>Thinking more on the issue, I reached a conclusion similar to what <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"130046\">@Alex Gaynor</span> points out: stack smash protection could benefit any function with a stack variable whose address is potentially passed to an unsafe block. The precise criterion should in practice be refined both to make analysis feasible and to strike a balance between security and performance (probably resulting in options similar to <code>-fstack-protector-{all,strong,}</code> as in gcc/clang, with the opportunity to make \"strong\" even stronger by excluding stack variables which are definitely only used by safe Rust). Notably though, this is not specific to C/C++ interop, since unsafe Rust code can be just as misbehaved? It's interesting to see that there have been few known vulnerabilities of this kind as <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"127617\">@Shnatsel</span> mentions, but this may be an unsatisfactory assurance for the paranoid.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think my main concern is about marketing. The lack of hardening such as stack smash protection makes the choice between Rust and C/C++ by definition a trade-off security-wise, regardless of how uneven the trade might be: Rust code is less likely to contain vulnerabilities, but as it stands has fewer defences if shit hits the fan. Is this understanding correct?</p>\n<p>I found an interesting if dated issue about adding a \"stack smash protection\" attribute to the generated LLVM functions (<a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/26612\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/26612</a>). Limited experimentation indicates that passing <code>-fstack-protector-{all,strong,}</code> to clang does more or less this: the output of <code>echo 'void f() { }' | clang++ -emit-llvm -x c++ - -S -o - -O2 &lt;ssp flag&gt;</code> delegates to LLVM by marking <code>f()</code> with a <code>sspreq</code>, <code>sspstrong</code>, or <code>ssp</code> attribute, respectively. Perhaps it's possible to build a rustc which adds these attributes without major compiler surgery?</p>",

Safe Rust offers an opportunity for making <code>-fstack-protector-strong</code> more precise, but as you say it seems tough to answer the question \"is this stack address definitely accessed by unsafe Rust\". A better question is perhaps to ask \"is this stack address definitely only accessed by safe Rust\", and exempting stack frames from protection if the answer is \"yes\" for all stack variables whose address is taken. Perhaps there should be an extra option to decide if the standard library is trusted. </p>\n<p>At any rate, I would consider having the choice of (none, some, strong, all) a major improvement over having no options at all, even if it turns out that strong ~= all for Rust code and requires Rust-specific adjustments to be meaningful.</p>",
