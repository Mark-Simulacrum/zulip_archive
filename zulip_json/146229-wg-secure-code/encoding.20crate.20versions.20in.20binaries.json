The question is how we can do it in a stable way that is maybe independent of the specific platform it is compiled for. Another question is whether it would be a good thing to add the dependencies by default, or let people enable the flag themselves? At one point you can say: The amount of bytes included is very small, on the other hand: Organizations that want to monitor their binaries probably will do that as a clear choice. If they actually never monitored their binaries for vulnerabilities and suddenly want to do so, they can always recompile and redeploy their application with these flags enabled.</p>",
