TLDR: You must have a valid token to make a request. In order to get a token, you must solve a proof-of-work problem. Each token is rate limited, so the maximum speed allowed is whichever of (per-token rate limit) and (rate of solving proof-of-work problems) is faster. Easily tunable so that you achieve numbers that you like, and minimally invasive to users who are behaving nicely.</p>",
