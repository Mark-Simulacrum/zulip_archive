The version can never be overwritten, and the code cannot be deleted.\" according to the <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/publishing.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/publishing.html\">publishing reference</a>.</p>\n<p>The problem however is this:</p>\n<p>Let's say we have our library MyCoolLib of version 1.0.0. We have a huge project and make use of MyCoolLib a lot. The people working on MyCoolLib however have not been sitting still and release a version 2.0.0 which contains a complete re-haul of the public interface. After a while when releasing 2.4.3 they suddenly discover a big vulnerability which is contained in the code both used by 1.0.0 and 2.0.0 versions! We can basically say to people using 2.0.0 that they just have to update their packages. However people still using 1.0.0 cannot update their dependency so easily since the public interface is completely different. Since we cannot fix the vulnerability once they are deployed we are kind of stuck with a problem.</p>\n<p>So I was wondering: Wouldn't it be a good idea to be able to re-publish earlier versions with fixes as long as the public interface doesn't change?</p>",

        "content": "<p>EDIT: I should have thought about this longer..... They can probably just release a 1.x.1 containing the fix and ask them to update to that instead right? That should fix the problem.

I wonder how many people do this instead of including the exact version (including patch number). I guess this should be a best practice right? If people truly all did this, and crate maintainers published bug fixes, then it can only go wrong when a specific version is locked in Cargo.lock, or an application is already deployed somewhere. Can you actually publish crates to <a href=\"http://crates.io\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a> using this syntax? Or would it be replaced with the a version including the patch number? After all you cannot be 100 percent sure if someone changes the public interface in a patch version right?</p>",
