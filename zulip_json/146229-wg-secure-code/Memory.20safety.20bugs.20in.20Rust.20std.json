Unfortunately, this makes memory safety bugs in the Rust standard library underrepresented than a bug in a toy crate on <a href=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a>.</li>\n<li>In the last attempt (<a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/561\">#561</a>), we decided to request a CVE number before creating a RustSec advisory to be consistent with other std bugs. This seems to be much slower than I expected. I requested CVE number through MITRE form but haven't heard back anything for 3.5 weeks.</li>\n<li>In comparison, id-map was reported to RustSec on April 2nd and got CVE numbers on April 7th, in 5 days. I don't know who it is, but some CVE authority seems to be monitoring RustSec bugs and filing CVEs for them.</li>\n<li>Can we do the same thing for std bugs?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Tracking issue: <a href=\"https://github.com/RustSec/advisory-db/issues/539\">#539</a></p>",
