I can't see any blockers for this other than a few documentation tweaks and the standard process in the <a href=\"https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html\">stabilization guide</a>.</p>\n<p>I'm sharing this here as it's gated behind <code>stdsimd</code> - do people have any objections to this before I do the work? Could other unstable parts of SIMD be included too? Is there something I might have missed (I'm quite new to the Rust project)? Thank you!</p>",
