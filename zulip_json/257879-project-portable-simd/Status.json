Apache Arrow uses bitmaps to represent values validity, which is aimed at m1 (AXV512) masks. I have a SIMD abstraction to plug different SIMD representations in <a href=\"https://github.com/jorgecarleitao/arrow2\">https://github.com/jorgecarleitao/arrow2</a>, and would like to give stdsimd a try.</p>\n<p>E.g. I have been trying to hit AXV512 instructions with m1 masks, but I have been unsuccessful in using things like <code>u16</code> masks over <code>[f32;16]</code> arrays. I believe that packed_simd does not support m1xX masks.</p>",

However, it's not totally out of scope to try and support some of what avx512 offers.</p>",
