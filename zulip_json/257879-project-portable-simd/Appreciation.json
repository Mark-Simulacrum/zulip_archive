The <code>size_hint</code> in <code>['A', 'C', 'T', 'G'].iter().map(|n| (*n, 0)).collect()</code> is going to be accurate -- the slice iter is known to be 4, and <code>map</code> is size-hint-preserving, so the collect will see that it's going to be <code>(4, Some(4))</code>, and pre-allocate the <code>HashMap</code> accordingly.</p>",
