People seem to think there's a super-proper place for things because there are streams and topics. But it's not infinitely nested, and a topic is the last division of meaning. As long as you've made a reasonable effort to find a spot for what you want to talk about, and we're not in the middle of a meeting right then and there, it's fine to make new topics for anything. </p>\n<p>That's why I made this topic: because people sometimes feel awkward about making new topics, especially for introducing themselves, so I figured I'd have one where I explicitly grant permission. You can feel free to introduce yourself in this topic, in <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"122652\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/122652-new-members\">#new members</a>, or in a new topic, and ask any questions you want wherever seems appropriate.</p>",
