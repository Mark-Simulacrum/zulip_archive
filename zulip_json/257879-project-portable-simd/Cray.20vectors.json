I suppose GPU vector processors are themselves only sort of ambiguously registers, but I'm not sure it's as important to discuss Cray vectors and might be confusing if we associate them with RISCV-V vectors since there's more daylight between Cray vectors and any other vector than between e.g. SVE and RISCV-V</p>",
