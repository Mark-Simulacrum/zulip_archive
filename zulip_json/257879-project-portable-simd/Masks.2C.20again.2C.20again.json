In the case of AVX-512, rely on the optimizer to convert full-width masks to bitmasks (I've seen that it can do it, at least in pretty trivial examples).  If you build with the AVX-512 target feature, I think it can default to bitmasks instead (this doesn't really help <code>std</code>, but we can do it as a proof of concept).</li>\n<li>Provide two new functions on integers: converting <code>SimdI{N}</code> to integers by taking the sign bits, and the inverse operation for sign-extending integers to vectors.</li>\n<li>Provide new functions on masks: converting <code>Mask{N}</code> to <code>SimdI{N}</code> and <code>Mask{N}</code> to integer, and the inverse operations.  We can indicate that some of these operations are free, depending on architecture (basically, free if they're the same size)</li>\n</ul>",

I have been thinking more about the calling convention problem that is holding us back, and I believe gating our repr on feature level is more practical.
