I have a question about <code>packed_simd</code> which I guess is owned by this working group now?</p>\n<p>I'm stuck on trying to get a _gather_ instruction generated. I think I need to use something like  <a href=\"https://docs.rs/packed_simd/0.3.3/packed_simd/type.cptrx4.html#method.read\"><code>cptrx4::read</code></a> for that. This is my current setup: <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/KarelPeeters/9b1fb30228258950e2452eb732ff5a91\">https://gist.github.com/KarelPeeters/9b1fb30228258950e2452eb732ff5a91</a>. I can't figure out how to get the pointer array itself setup though, conceptally I just want <code>cptrx4::splat(vec.as_ptr()) + indices</code>. I guess I need some combination of <code>.to_bits()</code>/<code>.cast()</code>/<code>std::mem::transmute()</code> but I'm not sure what exactly and which of those are safe to use for pointers.</p>\n<p>Does anyone know how to get there? Thanks!</p>",
