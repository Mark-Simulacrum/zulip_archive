I'm writing a talk on Rust SIMD for Monday and realised that I was out of date.</p>\n<p>I'm looking at the RFCs and stdsimd right now. I used packed_simd a couple of years ago in the arrow crate and my own private bioinformatics work. I'll see if there are any issues that I can take up. Always a good way to learn a project.</p>\n<p>Thanks, Andy.</p>",
