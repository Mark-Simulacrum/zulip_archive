For example, while I'm on t-lang I'm occasionally the reviewer on random libs or compiler things where it would be fine to ping me -- if it's a weird thing that I can't resolve then I should probably be moving it over to someone officially on libs/compiler (who then wouldn't be pinged) to get it unstuck.   But that's nuanced so being conservative is fine too.  And many lang people are also on compiler or libs or similar so this likely wouldn't come up for them.</p>\n<p>(I wholly agree with not pinging the always-swamped t-compiler folks for compiler stuff, of course, and similarly for other teams.)</p>",
