Also they need to be updated when the nightly/beta get branched, but there is automation to be done here <span aria-label=\"robot\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f916\" role=\"img\" title=\"robot\">:robot:</span></li>\n<li>the area of the bug, AKA the <code>A-*</code> labels: if you can figure it out, because it sometimes isn't obvious.</li>\n<li>if the bug requires a nightly compiler, e.g. requires a gated feature, label it as <code>requires-nightly</code>, and add the appropriate <code>F-*</code> label when applicable</li>\n<li>if the bug is known to be platform-specific, add the appropriate <code>O-*</code> label(s)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you think the bug deserves some attention, don't hesitate, please tag it as <code>I-prioritize</code>. This will ping the Prioritization WG so we can discuss the priority of the given bug, nominate it to T-compiler meetings, etc. Note that regressions (and soon soundness issues) are automatically prioritized.</p>\n<p>Also don't forget to add the <code>C-bug</code> and <code>T-compiler</code>.
