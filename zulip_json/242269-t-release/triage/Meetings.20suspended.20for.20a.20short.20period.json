Due to irl reasons, I can't commit to being available at a certain time and we also don't have much to discuss at the moment. </p>\n<p>In that case I won't be hosting the meeting for next few months. If anyone wishes to lead a meeting you can feel free to do so just ensure you inform the group. </p>\n<p>Thanks and stay safe</p>",
