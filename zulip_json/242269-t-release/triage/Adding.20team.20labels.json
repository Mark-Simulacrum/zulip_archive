Not sure where exactly this chore falls under (wg-triage or <span class=\"user-group-mention\" data-user-group-id=\"2403\">@WG-prioritization</span>), but we should be adding team labels (T-compiler, T-libs-api, etc.) to PRs. Particularly, the compiler team agenda is using the T-compiler label to identify PRs based on last review activity. There are currently <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pulls?page=1&amp;q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Acreated-asc+-label%3AT-compiler+-label%3AT-lang+-label%3AT-rustdoc+-label%3AT-libs-api+-label%3AT-libs\">170</a> PRs without a team label. I don't think it's critical that <em>new</em> PRs get a label, but I think PRs older than 2-3 weeks definitely need to get labels so we can track them. (I also think that we should be labeling all PRs, not just S-waiting-on-review)</p>",
