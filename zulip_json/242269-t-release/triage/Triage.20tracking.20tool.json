I'm not sure if this group will find this useful, but I've been working on a GitHub issue triage tool that might be helpful: <a href=\"https://github.com/rylev/triage-tracker\">https://github.com/rylev/triage-tracker</a></p>\n<p>I just added support for seeing stale issues (i.e., issues that have not been commented on) since a given date. For example,<br>\n<code>triage-tracker triaged A-diagnostics --since 2020-07-01</code> finds all issues labeled with <code>A-diagnostics</code> that have not been commented on since at least last July 1st. If you don't provide a date it defaults to 1 year in the past. </p>\n<p>There's also functionality for seeing what the net issue closure is for a given time span. For instance <code>triage-tracker closings range -s 2021-06-07 -e 2021-05-31</code> will tell you the difference in issue (re)openings vs issue closures. Ideally this number is always negative so that we're closing more issues than are opened. </p>\n<p>Let me know if anyone finds this potentially useful. There's lots we could do with it including hooking it up to a bot that informs us when issues have become stale.</p>",
