Thank you.\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>This left me a bit puzzled about how to do this. I known that 'labels' are a github feature, but i didn't seen any UI for changing those. Searching for 'github set label' was not really helpful either. Thus I just asked on the PR how to handle this. Thankfully some kind soul (thanks hkratz) gave me the hint (and by that did this for me):</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code> Like this:\n@rustbot label -S-waiting-on-author +S-waiting-on-review\n\n(rustbot documentation)\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Instead it would be nice when rustbot could give such an hint in the first place:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>Ping from triage:\n@cehteh can you please address the comments then reply with &#39;@rustbot label -S-waiting-on-author +S-waiting-on-review&#39;\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Looks to me like some very simple change which would make contribution a lot simpler (and bind less human resources, petting noobs like me).</p>\n<p>Furthermore, a bit more complicated: How about a '@rustbot done' command, which just scans what it requested most recently from the user and then applies that (Of course rustbots helpful hint should then include '... or reply with @rustbot done).</p>",
