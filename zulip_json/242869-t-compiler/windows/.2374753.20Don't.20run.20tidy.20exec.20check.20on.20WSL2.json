So there is no problem with building Rust inside it.<br>\nThe issue is building in WSL2 from Windows mount (<code>/mnt/&lt;letter&gt;</code>). Unlike on typical Linux distro where NTFS is accessed directly, in WSL2 all the mounts are working through P9 protocol. That can create issues with lockfiles and is also unbearably slow. Out of curiosity I tried netbsd dist job that takes ~1 hour on my PC on Linux using Docker for Windows with WSL2 backend, I killed it after 5 hours when it was still running CMake for the target LLVM...</p>",
