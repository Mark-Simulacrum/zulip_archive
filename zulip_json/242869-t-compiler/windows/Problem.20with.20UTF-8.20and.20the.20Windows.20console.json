I have written my first pull request and would love to get some feedback on it, see <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/83342\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/83342</a></p>\n<p>The problem is that writes of just an incomplete multi-byte UTF-8 codepoint to stdout attached to a Windows console return an error even though further bytes could complete the codepoint. This is currently a rare occurence due to line buffering but will become more pronounced once stdout buffering can be turned off.</p>",
