At the moment, we use chalk from <a href=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a> (published weekly). </p>\n<p>This means that upgrade process now includes \"waiting for the next version of chalk with specific bugfixes to be released\": <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/pull/4982#issuecomment-648666221\">https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/pull/4982#issuecomment-648666221</a>. </p>\n<p>I think, in isolation, this is not problematic.

This means accepting some overhead.</li>\n<li>Both rust-analyzer and rustc use \"master\" chalk (git dependency). I don't know what this means exactly, I recall there were some problems with git deps and vendoring? cc <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116122\">@simulacrum</span> , as that directly affects \"rustuping rust-analyzer\" work.</li>\n</ul>",
