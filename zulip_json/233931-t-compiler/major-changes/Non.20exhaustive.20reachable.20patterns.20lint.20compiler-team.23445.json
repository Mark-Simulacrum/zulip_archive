There is a rather large problem in the normal lint, it cannot detect guards or or-patterns, basically it would have to use/reimplement parts of the mechanics of <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/compiler/rustc_mir_build/src/thir/pattern/check_match.rs\">check_match</a>. It seems to me that adding the lint to the usefulness and check_match files makes sense.</p>\n<p>I was able to make the lint work for <a href=\"https://github.com/DevinR528/rust/commit/df377ca309fd5acf1a3dcdcb90ecdfef9578eafb\">enums</a> but am having trouble with structs and variants with fields <a href=\"https://github.com/DevinR528/rust/commits/useful-reachable\">WIP commits</a>. Not really sure how to go about checking for the attribute (either place, see bellow) or the best way to skip the <code>..</code> rest/wildcardish and check for missing fields.</p>\n<p>The other issue is where the attribute should be placed? In the <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/84332\">issue</a> as well as the <code>non_exhaustive</code> PR <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/44109#issuecomment-521781237\">comments</a> it was mentioned adding the attribute to the wildcard in a match</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">match</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Bar</span>::<span class=\"n\">A</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">Bar</span>::<span class=\"n\">A</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{},</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">Bar</span>::<span class=\"n\">B</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{},</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"cp\">#[deny(reachable)]</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"c1\">// attribute goes here or on the expression</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">_</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{}</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"c1\">// triggers lint \"missing Bar::C...\"</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The problem with this is that it's struct counterpart  isn't exactly valid <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81282\">issue</a></p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">let</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Foo</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">b</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"cp\">#[warn(reachable)]</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"o\">..</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"c1\">// triggers lint \"missing field `c`...\"</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">structure</span><span class=\"p\">;</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>So the options are to make this valid or put the attribute on the expr/stmt instead of the wild patterns.</p>\n<p>I also opened a lang-team <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/112\">https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/112</a> and zulip <a href=\"#narrow/stream/243200-t-lang.2Fmajor-changes/topic/Non.20exhaustive.20reachable.20patterns.20lint.20lang-team.23112\">https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/243200-t-lang.2Fmajor-changes/topic/Non.20exhaustive.20reachable.20patterns.20lint.20lang-team.23112</a></p>",
