Presumably there is a similar need for tvos-sim etc, right? It looks like this is the only -sim target we currently have, I'm wondering if there's something that makes it unique.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, I think this largely looks good to me - I'll need to spend some time re-reading the relevant sections of the RFC to figure out the right next steps, but presumably someone who has some familiarity here can rustbot second on the issue. I don't feel comfortable doing that myself as I've never done any iOS development etc.</p>",

Way less people have watches and even less have Apple TV, and the kind of apps you make for those devices are heavily restricted in functionality and as Badboy mentioned how you can ship. You’re also heavily encouraged to use Swift for development especially on the watch and TV. I think we can hold off on considering those until someone else has a need for them.</p>\n<p>I don’t think there’s a technical problems with running Rust on those platforms though. I believe there are hobbyists making stuff targeting the watch for example. You just need to pass <code>--emit=llvm-bc</code> to the build. I don’t think Apple has any explicit toolchain requirements for bitcode, but I haven’t actually tried publishing a Rust bitcode watchOS or tvOS app to the App Store so I don’t know.</p>",
