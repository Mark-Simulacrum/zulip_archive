That worked but it made the instrumentation pass pretty complex because we basically doubled (or more) the number of function calls in a given body. </p>\n<p>Recently, we changed this and added a <code>Coverage</code> statement which just lowers to the intrinsic and cannot unwind. I actually suggested adding <code>StatementKind::Call</code> at that time instead of the more specific <code>Coverage</code> statement but now I'm glad we didn't do that. <code>Coverage</code> has simple semantics and 90% of the compiler doesn't need to care about it at all so it's very easy to see that it's handled correctly.

I just read the LLVM lang ref and it says \"The compiler may assume execution will continue after a volatile operation, so operations which modify memory or may have undefined behavior can be hoisted past a volatile operation.\" (<a href=\"https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#volatile-memory-accesses\">https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#volatile-memory-accesses</a>)., so it would indeed be UB for a volatile memory access to be followed by \"unreachable\".</p>",
