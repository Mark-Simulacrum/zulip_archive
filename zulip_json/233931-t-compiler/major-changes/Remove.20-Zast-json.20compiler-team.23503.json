If you think this would benefit from discussion amongst the team, consider proposing a design meeting.</p>",

Without this flag, I think we would need to link directly to rustc_parse. That's not a blocker, and wg-grammar is mostly defunct, but I wanted to point out that there were use cases for it.</p>",
