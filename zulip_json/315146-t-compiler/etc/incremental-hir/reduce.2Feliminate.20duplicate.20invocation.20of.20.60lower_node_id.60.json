In many cases (all cases that do not involve the resolver and things with DefIds), we can actually only lower the ID once and pass it around, as it's only needed locally. One example is pattern lowering. We lower the pattern's id multiple times, mostly out of convenience. We could instead pass the lowered id around together with the pattern and never look at the pattern's node id except to call into the resolver.</p>",
