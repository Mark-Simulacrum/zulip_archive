Although I think I would need you to help me clarify some things I feel I don't fully understand the intricacies of. I can try to read more into that and write down questions and  we could also use that 30min time slot for clarifying things. I'm in CET time and would prefer doing this in the evening, so anywhere in the range 12-5:30pm in your time would be fine for me, if thats ok for you.</p>",
