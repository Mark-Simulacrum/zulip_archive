This problem is annoying hard to google for, due to a certain website with a name that looks like my error message.  But after tweaking my search terms a bit, I eventually had <a href=\"https://rust-lang.github.io/wg-async-foundations/vision/status_quo/alan_runs_into_stack_trouble.html\">Alan runs into stack allocation trouble</a> at the top of my search results. </p>\n<p>This is notable because this Status Quo story almost exactly captured my symptoms (though I haven't yet found a solution), and because this is the <a href=\"#narrow/stream/187312-wg-async-foundations/topic/tonight.20i'm.20barbara\">second time</a> I've felt a very strong connection to these stories.</p>\n<p>All of which tells me that the wg-async-foundations is 100% on the right track</p>",
