I work as a software development manager by day but can offer you some of my free time. I am not sure what I could do to help but you can review the Rust code I have written to give yourself an idea of what might be appropriate. I wrote a wrapper around the Oracle OCI libary <a href=\"https://github.com/huwwynnjones/oci_rs\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/huwwynnjones/oci_rs\">https://github.com/huwwynnjones/oci_rs</a>.  I have not worked on any other part of the Rust project. Let me know if/what you need and if there is any primer documentation that would be worth me reading first. <br>\nThanks <br>\nHuw</p>",
