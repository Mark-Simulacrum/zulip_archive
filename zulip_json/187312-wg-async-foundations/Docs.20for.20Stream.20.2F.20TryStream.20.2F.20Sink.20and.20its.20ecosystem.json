Specifically, it's wasn't clear to me what the relationship between Stream, TryStream and their extension traits were. Especially when dealing with the different asynchronous runtimes, I was under the mistaken impression that I couldn't use mix them between async runtimes (this is aggravated by the fact that a lot of function signatures changes between tokio and futures, for example).</p>\n<p>This looks like a good first doc contribution, and I was wondering where the best place would be to document this, there are some docs in the different async runtimes, but as a beginner it can be tedious to navigate between these when you don't know the relationship between the projects.</p>\n<p>Maybe the async book would be a good starting point?</p>",
