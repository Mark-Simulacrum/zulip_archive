What lifetimes does the generated `Future` have?\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Those are <strong>really</strong> tricky! The returned <code>Future</code>s will always have a different lifetime than what they store. It obviously needs to be shorter, since otherwise the Future could outlive the lifetime of its content. But it's really hard to refer to those lifetime in applications in a way which doesn't end up in trial and error. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately I have no real hint advise on how to deal with it apart from \"do try and error\", and \"try to minimize lifetimes\" :'(.
