It looks like <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/8850893d96252172700727fe9e746c8e1ebd5853/compiler/rustc_infer/src/infer/error_reporting/need_type_info.rs#L358\">this function</a> is the one where handling needs to be added for async blocks. Those will show up as <code>ty::Generator</code> instead of <code>ty::Closure</code>. We may also want to check that they actually come from an async lowering by checking the <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir/struct.Body.html#method.generator_kind\"><code>generator_kind</code></a> on the body.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/8850893d96252172700727fe9e746c8e1ebd5853/compiler/rustc_trait_selection/src/traits/error_reporting/suggestions.rs#L1513\">This code</a> might be helpful as an example of async/await specific diagnostics.</p>\n<p>Feel free to ask questions here.</p>",

The function you specified is indeed hit when constructing the error. The only thing within that function which is matched against <code>ty::Closure</code> is <code>local_visitor.found_node_ty</code>, and I found that that's an option set to <code>None</code> when running the compiler on the code in the issue. Of course, I may be missing something, but perhaps there's a <code>ty::Generator</code> in another variable I'm not aware of?</p>",
