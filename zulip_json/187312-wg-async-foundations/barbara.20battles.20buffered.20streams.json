Seen that in dozens of code reviews and slack questions around \"can you please explain me what is going on here?\". Since I'm now doing this for a while I personally understand the combinator versions - but it still takes my brain more time to digest and interpret than other variants.

        "content": "<p>hey, I'm late to the party here and may be writing in the wrong place, but anyway, here goes:</p>\n<p>I'm writing a simple cli tool to dump objects from s3 to stdout and want to make use of the buffered combinator so multiple objects can be downloaded (buffered) concurrently, while one object gets streamed directly to stdout at a time. Since objects can be big, I believe I can end up hitting this sharp edge.</p>\n<p>However, it seems that a work-around is to forward to a sink instead of using for_each. Since the Forward future that gets polled sits between the sink and stream, it should be possible to ensure that those futures keep making progress. For buffer_unordered, one could maybe use a mutex to delay future completion until the sink is ready. For buffer, I guess a semaphore in front of the Buffer and another buffer on the sink side could work.</p>\n<p>In akka streams there's this notion of an \"async boundary\" which seems related. Basically if you do .async on a stream, then you split the stream into two actors. This seems like a related notion, and I guess something similar can be done adhoc for rust streams by creating a channel, forwarding your stream to the sink end, spawning the Forward future on a runtime, and returning the stream end of the channel.</p>\n<p>I wasn't sure this would have any interest, or if this was the right place for my comment... but anyway here it is. If it turns out to be interesting in some way, I'm happy to help out turning it into something other people can use (docs or extra operator or maybe a crate), but I have limited Rust experience, having worked mostly on a few of my own small stand-alone projects</p>",
