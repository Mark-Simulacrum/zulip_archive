For this Friday's meeting, we'll keep the same time of <time datetime=\"2021-09-03T17:00:00Z\">2021-09-03T10:00:00-07:00</time>, but hopefully by next week we can pick a new time.</p>\n<p>I'll post a few options down below, so vote for the ones that work for you. If you'd like to propose a new time, go ahead and respond to this thread. I'll consider the poll open through Friday's meeting and hopefully there will be a clear winner by then.</p>",
