As far as we can tell, there is no hard blocker to this -- it requires us to add some form of argument to generators, but it doesn't require that this interface be \"stable\" (or close to stable). We also probably don't even need to have <em>syntax</em> for accessing a generator's argument, just a HIR node. Probably <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"127859\">@Taylor Cramer</span> has the best idea of what's involved, or maybe <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116466\">@Zoxc</span>.</p>\n<p>We had talked about the possibility of <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"203289\">@boats</span> doing the impl work here, though it might be better to find them some other \"first bug\", not sure how complex this will be.</p>",
