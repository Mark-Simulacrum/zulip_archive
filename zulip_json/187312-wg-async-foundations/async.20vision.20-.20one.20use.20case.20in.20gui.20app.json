The current async ecosystem is tailored for servers - so most work has gone into optimizing for the <em>multithreaded, work-stealing</em> type of executors/runtimes, where the workload is assumed to be uniform in terms of scheduling requirements. Most do <em>not</em> offer thread affinity, task priorities, deadlines which you might want if you're writing games, device drivers etc - e.g. workloads where you have a latency-sensitive UI thread/task loop.</p>\n<p>There is nothing prevent async Rust focusing on that - in fact, the <a href=\"https://github.com/bastion-rs/bastion\">Bastion</a> runtime has been innovating in this space, but still with focus on servers. I suspect that if you want most bang-for-the-buck building a game <em>today</em>, your best bet is a good thread pool library and synchronous concurrent data structures (e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam\">crossbeam</a> and/or <a href=\"https://github.com/Amanieu/parking_lot\">parking_lot</a>).</p>\n<p>That said, if you are ok with digging deeper, you might consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Run a hybrid system I/O workloads run on some threads. Challenges would be finding interoperable concurrent data structures and debugging/profiling might be more difficult.</li>\n<li>Write or extend an async Runtime to support deadlines/priorities/&lt;other custom behavior&gt; and use async throughout. This is inherently complex and might require rewriting code for async (both your own code and crates you're currently using)</li>\n</ul>",
