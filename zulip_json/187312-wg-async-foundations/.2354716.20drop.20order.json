What I've done instead is introduce a new field to <code>ast::IsAsync</code> and then modify the arguments/block in a few places that it was needed. That got me further into the compiler than where I was before (after a long detour getting the new statements to have ids). It now errors in the MIR gen, but I suspect that is because of failures in type check. I've not had a chance to dig into that though.</p>\n<p>I'm not that pleased with the approach it takes. I can't think of a better way, it just feels like the amount of changes it has taken is way more than it should be and there should be somewhere I can make the change to the function's lowering and that would just propagate through the compiler unchanged - I guess that place is probably the parser, but I don't think we'd want that.</p>",

There are currently three issues with the PR:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Currently <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/test/ui/async-fn-multiple-lifetimes.rs\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/test/ui/async-fn-multiple-lifetimes.rs\">this test</a> (<a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/test/ui/async-fn-multiple-lifetimes.stderr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/test/ui/async-fn-multiple-lifetimes.stderr\">expected stderr</a>) is the only one that is still failing (at least, before I rebased and introduced the type inference error below). I've managed to fix a handful of the issues that the test originally had, but I'm left with <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/davidtwco/02f0fa124e193a12d6ff21f6b0d4e61e\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://gist.github.com/davidtwco/02f0fa124e193a12d6ff21f6b0d4e61e\">this stderr diff</a>. I am unsure if this is correct and expected.</li>\n<li>There's also a pre-existing issue that meant I couldn't exactly match the drop-order of the equivalent <code>fn</code>. I mention that at the end of the PR description.</li>\n<li>When running the test, I get this error below. I've dug around for days and not really come up with much. This worked before the rebase, but might also be related to a recent change that removed the <code>&lt;ty&gt;</code> from <code>let &lt;pat&gt;: &lt;ty&gt; = __arg0;</code> because that broke when <code>&lt;ty&gt;</code> was <code>impl Trait</code>:</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>error[E0282]: type annotations needed\n  --&gt; ./src/test/run-pass/issue-54716.rs:36:14\n   |\n36 | async fn foo(x: D, _y: D) {\n   | ^ cannot infer type\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>In brief, the change modifies the <code>ast::IsAsync::Async</code> variant to introduce a <code>Vec&lt;AsyncArgument&gt;</code> containing a ident (<code>__arg0</code>), a statement (<code>let &lt;pat&gt; = __arg0;</code>) and a argument (<code>__arg0: &lt;ty&gt;</code>) for each of the original arguments of the function. There are corresponding changes to the visitors so that these get given ids. There are also a few other smaller changes that let me keep track of whether an argument/statement was introduced by the <code>async fn</code> lowering or not - this can help with diagnostics as in one of the commits. </p>\n<p>This is then used in the HIR lowering to, well, lower to the HIR - replacing the arguments of the function with our generated arguments above, and prepending the statements to the body of the function before it is lowered into the generator. But it is also used in the def collector and in name resolution as those need to work out what should be <code>Def::Upvar(..)</code> and other things like that. I decided to modify the AST to keep the arg and stmt so I didn't need to repeat creating them all of those places. </p>\n<p>Originally I tried modifying only the HIR and keeping only ids in the AST (as was contained in <code>IsAsync</code> previously), but I was struggling to get this to work - I think it would be a preferable solution (I want to limit the amount of  AST changes), but getting the name resolution and def collection to work, given just the ids, was challenging - I found just adding the new statements before they would normally do their thing was much more straightforward.</p>",
