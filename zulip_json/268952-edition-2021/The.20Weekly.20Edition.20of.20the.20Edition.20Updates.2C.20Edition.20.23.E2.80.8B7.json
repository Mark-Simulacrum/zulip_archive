See <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/blog.rust-lang.org/pull/825\">the draft blog post</a> for an overview.</p>\n<p>Next steps are: 1. implementing these changes, 2. implementing all related migration lints, 3. documentation</p>\n<p>1 and 2 are already done for most of the features. (Thanks!) These are still open:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prelude changes: <code>prelude::rust_2021</code> <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/82217\">already exists</a> and works, just <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3114#issuecomment-828345093\">waiting for libs FCP</a> to add the three traits to it. Migration plan is available, but implementation of this lint has not yet started.</li>\n<li>Upgraded lints: <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/83213\">PR</a> waiting to be merged.</li>\n<li>Disjoint captures: I believe this is nearing completion (both implementation and migration lint). (cc <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"281950\">@Aman Arora</span>) Draft blog post about the feature <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/g0odgclDSaODOvBSZntltg\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>Reserved prefixed tokens: FCP complete. Implementation and migration lint still need to be done.</li>\n<li>IntoIter for arrays: Implementation and basic lint availalbe, but <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/84513\">lots of small improvements</a> to the lint and documentation can still be made.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As for documentation: We first need to <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82940\">prepare the edition guide for Rust 2021</a>, to make space for the new documentation. Once that's done, we'll make sure every edition change gets its own page.</p>\n<p>This means we're still on schedule, heading towards releasing a feature-complete 2021 edition in a few months! Thanks everyone! <span aria-label=\"yellow heart\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f49b\" role=\"img\" title=\"yellow heart\">:yellow_heart:</span></p>",
