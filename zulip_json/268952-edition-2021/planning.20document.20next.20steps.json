This was in the context of some core team meetings where we were talking about 2021 Edition planning and what the full scope of work looks like. I wanted to try and move that conversation into this channel.</p>\n<p>We created a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K7Oo4nqiA3hF62AfW02B7wLagoP1hY0Uv8qb0Cp33d0/edit\">google document</a> with planning -- it kind of duplicates the existing hackmd, but contains a bit of extra notes on milestones and things. It also has some more detailed updates on the likely candidates and other things.</p>\n<p>One of the immediate steps that I would like to do is to establish the \"viability criteria\" and a drop-dead date, probably in the not that distant future (e.g., feb 15). The idea being that in order to be considered for the edition, the viability criteria for an idea must be met. </p>\n<p>Our current draft of the 'viability criteria' was:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Accepted RFC, or RFC open on repo and “looking good”</li>\n<li>Migration, idiom lint plan in place</li>\n<li>Implementation either trivial or underway</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(cc <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"224872\">@rylev</span>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116011\">@Steve Klabnik</span> too)</p>",
