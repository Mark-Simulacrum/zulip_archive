We can continue to hash that out on the RFC and in the <a href=\"#narrow/stream/213817-t-lang/topic/pub.20macro.20rules\">zulip thread</a>, but I want to see how we're feeling about getting this RFC to a good place by the end of the month which is our soft deadline for inclusion in the 2021 edition. Do we see that as realistic?</p>",
