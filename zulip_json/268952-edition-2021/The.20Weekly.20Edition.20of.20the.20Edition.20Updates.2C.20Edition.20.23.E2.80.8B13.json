(<a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/85707\">#85707</a>) Just needs some finishing touches and getting merged.</li>\n<li>Reserved prefixes: All implemented, including migration lint. Approved by niko and matklad, just waiting for the final reviewer. (<a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/85359\">#85359</a>)</li>\n<li>IntoIterator for Arrays: Lint updates (<a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/85682\">#85682</a>) still waiting for review.</li>\n<li><code>--force-warn</code>: Still needs to be stabilized.</li>\n<li>Disjoint captures: <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"281950\">@Aman Arora</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116009\">@nikomatsakis</span> How do we track this? The project board and tracking issue haven't been updated in a while.</li>\n<li>Crater run: We still need to find a way to test all the migration lints on crater. We want to apply the fixes with <code>cargo fix --edition</code>, but then also run <code>cargo test</code> <em>in the new edition</em>. This needs a new cargo flag/command or new crater mode (or both).</li>\n</ul>",
