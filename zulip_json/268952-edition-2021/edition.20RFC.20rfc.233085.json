The only thing I can think is to add a note about edition idioms, i.e., to address what <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"120518\">@Eric Huss</span> <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3085#discussion_r611984779\">wrote here</a>, but it seems like a minor point. I think that if we do wind up fixing the impl so that we can have the same lint belong to both a normal group and an edition-related group that is used by cargo fix (and can be enabled indiscriminately), then i'd be happy to designate some lints as \"edition idiom lints\" (in my mind, then, they'd be both regular style lints, fixing things to look better in the new edition, and also idiom lints, in that they're targeting new code styles enabled by the edition).</p>",
