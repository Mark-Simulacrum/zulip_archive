I know of two questions</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do we retool the compiler so that we can have a single lint that is both a migration lint <em>and</em> an ordinary lint?  (Current plan: yes)</li>\n<li>Is there a need for \"idiom lints\", which are lints that are applied as part of migration to help code in Rust 2021 be nice? (Answer: yes)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The latter one was only controversial in the sense that I wasn't sure if \"idiom lint\" was a useful category long term. I tend to think that those \"idiom lints\" are mostly style lints that ought to be on all the time; however, I think having a (non-exclusive) category of \"idiom lints\" that are 'force-enabled' by tooling is great. </p>\n<p>It's that a lot of times those lints might more naturally belong elsewhere. For example, a lint about \"unused <code>extern</code> crate\" might wind up being able to fire a lot more (or only!) in Rust 2018, but I would imagine it belongs as part of the 'unused' group primarily. (is there such a group?)</p>\n<p>Anyway, I think this is mostly a question to be resolved with specifics. We should certainly have a central list (which we don't, presently) of all the migration plans and which ones take place in rust 2018 and which require action in rust 2021 too.</p>",
