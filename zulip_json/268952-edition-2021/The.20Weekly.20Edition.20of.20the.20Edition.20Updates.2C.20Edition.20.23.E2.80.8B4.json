Automated migration doesn't work yet because of the rustfix multi-span issue. (See below.)</li>\n<li>Range types: This discussion hasn't converged, so probably not going to make it for edition 2021. cc <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"243558\">@Steven Fackler</span></li>\n<li><code>k#</code> keywords: This got extended/generalized to reserving <code>anything#</code> and <code>anything\"..\"</code>. But now it's unclear what 'reserved' means. Do we tokenize but not parse, or also refuse to tokenize? This makes a difference for (proc) macros. And for <code>anything\"..\"</code> there's some ongoing discussion about things like <code>fr\"\\\"</code> (is that a raw literal or not?). cc <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"125270\">@scottmcm</span></li>\n<li>Prelude changes: Crater report is available, but we still need a migration lint plan. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"226095\">@Dirkjan Ochtman</span> any updates?</li>\n<li>Or patterns: Migration lint implemented. Discussion on the name for <code>:pat_atom</code> still ongoing <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/83386\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>Disjoint captures: <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"281950\">@Aman Arora</span> What's the status?</li>\n<li>IntoIter for <code>[T; N]</code> - Doesn't seem feasible as an edition change. Discussion about landing this on all editions ongoing <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/65819\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>rustc_args_required_const: This has been discussed in the language meeting a while ago, but I don't think there's any updates in the last week or two. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"143274\">@Amanieu</span> ?</li>\n<li>Lints: <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"224872\">@rylev</span>?</li>\n<li>try_trait_v2: RFC entered FCP. But will probably not do anything edition-specific.</li>\n<li>rustfix multi-span issue: Nobody is working on this yet. See <a href=\"#narrow/stream/268952-edition-2021/topic/rustfix.20multi-span\">this topic</a>.</li>\n</ul>",
