I'm referring to <code>rustc -W help</code> and <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/lints/listing/warn-by-default.html\">this page</a>, neither of which currently knows how to handle edition-switching lints. I think <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81244\">#81244</a> would be the first of such lints, and I'm concerned that people may be confused if they look at the docs and it says one thing (that it is a \"warning\") but in reality it is different (it is \"deny\" in 2021).</p>\n<p>I don't know if anyone actually looks at those docs, so it may not matter.  Just wanted to see if anyone else would care.</p>",
