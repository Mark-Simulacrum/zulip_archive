If I follow the lint's suggestion and use <code>pat_param</code> everywhere, then when 2021 comes around the code will still work but I won't be using <code>pat</code> like I would like. On the other hand, if I just ignore the warning, then in 2021 I will be able to use the migration and get a better result. So that seems like a perverse incentive to silence the lint (a future incompatible lint, no less).</p>\n<p>Would it be possible to introduce a <code>k#pat2021</code> matcher that works in old editions and can be cleaned up by a lint in 2021 edition? That would allow me to make the meaningful migration now, in advance of the edition boundary, and the second step can be fully automatic and pain free.</p>",
