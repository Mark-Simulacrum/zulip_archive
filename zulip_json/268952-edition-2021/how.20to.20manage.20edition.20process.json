There's a pretty long tail I suspect of testing and documentation for each feature and we're generally not great at cutting things I find (vs someone feeling on the hook to get that work done). I'd rather ship a smaller edition and leave some stuff on the table for next time than having people working 24/7 in the last couple weeks or months before release.</p>",
