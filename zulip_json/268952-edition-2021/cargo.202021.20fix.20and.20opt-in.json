Otherwise, I'd like to move forward with it.</p>\n<p>In short, it makes it a little easier to test 2021 while it is unstable by adding <code>cargo-features = [\"edition2021\"]</code> at the top of <code>Cargo.toml</code>.   It also makes it so <code>cargo fix --edition</code> migrates to the <em>next</em> edition, so if we end up with any 2021 changes, they can be more easily tested on real projects.  I also added some more output to the <code>cargo fix</code> process to make it clearer what it is doing.</p>",
