        "content": "<p>Hey, I don't know about anyone else but I've had a few issues with our current solutions for group collaboration tools/services. I'd like to find better solutions for these, I've outlined some of my motivation for these tools below and separated them in sections. <em>Primary</em> which are things I think we should try to address first, and <em>Secondary</em> for nice to haves.</p>\n<h2>Primary</h2>\n<h3>Calendar</h3>\n<p>Right now we have a public Google Calendar for community team meetings and community events. We also have a compiler team calendar. However to my knowledge not every team has a public calendar, and there is no way without importing every calendar, to see all of the Rust team meetings.</p>\n<p>I'd like to try to have every public team meeting viewable in a public calendar. This would be beneficial for both new and elder members. New members would have a single place to see what meetings are happening and join ones they are interested in. When creating meetings, being able to see other teams schedule helps you avoid conflicts with members that are on multiple teams (a common situation in our organisation).</p>\n<h3>File-sharing</h3>\n<p>As Rust grows, more work is done in areas where manual version control with git is a hindrance. For instance this week I updated the favicon for the Rust website. This work was done with Affinity Designer (An alternative to Photoshop). I would like to keep the source work saved somewhere where other team members can access it. Even in this case where it's not likely to be updated frequently, I'm hesitant to put it in git because it will pollute the history of the repository and make clones take longer.</p>\n<p>Another problem I have run into is when documents need to be private, we don't have a great solution that provides group level permission into files. I don't know how many times while organising the all hands I had to fiddle with GSuite's permissions on documents to ensure all the correct people could see the documents. </p>\n<h2>Secondary</h2>\n<h3>Video Meetings</h3>\n<p>Right now some members have access to paid Zoom accounts to create video calls, and we also have Discord video calls. However Discord's calls aren't publicly join-able and not everyone can create a Zoom call when they need to. It would be nice if could offer all members a solution that allows any member to host video calls.</p>\n<h2>Potential Solutions</h2>\n<p>Right now the only solution I've explored in depth is <a href=\"https://nextcloud.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://nextcloud.com\">Nextcloud</a>, simply because they are an out of the box solution to the above three problems, which can be hosted or provided for us, and are open source. I'd be interested in solutions that are not Nextcloud though and any potential solutions don't have to address all at once.</p>",
