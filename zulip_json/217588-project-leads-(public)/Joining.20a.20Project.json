One issue that I've noticed is that people sometimes don't read, or remember, or ignore guidelines (especially if there are a lot of them), so I'm uncertain if more text would be counter-productive.  Also, Rust has a lot of different projects, each with their own contributor guidelines, which I think can add to the difficulty of successfully getting involved.</p>",

Short, emphasized headings, you'll actually read when you see a guideline like this and then short, easy to understand explanations.</p>",
