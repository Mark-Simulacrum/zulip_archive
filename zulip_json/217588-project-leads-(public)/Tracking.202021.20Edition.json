I've been wondering as we get closer to 2021 (hard to believe I know) if we should start to do the same? I was thinking of having a org project board that collects all the issues across the <code>rust</code> and the different repos. <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/rust-lang/projects\">https://github.com/orgs/rust-lang/projects</a></p>",

I don't have issues assigned yet as I wanted to make sure there was agreement on the structure. It's pretty straightforward hopefully.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Proposed</strong> — Any kind of issue around making a edition level change.</li>\n<li><strong>Accepted</strong> — An issue that the team has agreed should be included in the edition.</li>\n<li><strong>Implemented</strong> — The change is now available in nightly Rust.</li>\n<li><strong>Blocked</strong> — Any change that is blocked on a decision or external factor being resolved first.</li>\n<li><strong>Ready For Edition Release</strong> — The change has been in nightly and tested for long enough that we're confident in shipping it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another thing I think we should keep in perspective is when is it too late for a change to make it in the edition. I'm not purposing we have strict policy but for example I wouldn't imagine we'd allow a edition breaking change if there's no implementation by the time we're doing the precursor stable release.</p>\n<p>To that end has there been any thought on the edition release date? As looking up on my calendar the last rust releases of 2021 are the 9th of September, the 10th of October, and the 2nd of December.</p>",
