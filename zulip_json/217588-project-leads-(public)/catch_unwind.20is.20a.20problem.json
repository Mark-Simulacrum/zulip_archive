It sounds like at least Servo has no data showing that the performance improvement such a change could bring is worth it, but I'm wondering if any of you are aware if your domains would benefit from help here.</p>\n<p>If you have thoughts here I'd appreciate a comment on that issue or I'm happy to discuss here as well!</p>",
