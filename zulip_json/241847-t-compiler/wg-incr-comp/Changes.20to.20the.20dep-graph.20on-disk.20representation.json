It does not fundamentally change things - it just makes the compiler write the dep-graph to disk as it goes instead of all at once at the end. So I don't think an MCP is required (as long as the working group is aware of the changes).</p>",

I think the general direction definitely makes sense but we'll need to gather some data on how it affects file sizes. In general, getting rid of the LEB128 encoding (at least for incr. comp. caches) is a good idea and opens things up for further optimizations.</p>",
