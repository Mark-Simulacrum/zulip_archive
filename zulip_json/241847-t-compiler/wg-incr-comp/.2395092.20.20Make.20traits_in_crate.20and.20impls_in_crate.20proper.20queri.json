However, this creates a random-looking order.  This is still necessary because the order that comes from the visitor is the <code>DefIndex</code> order, which is incompatible avec incr comp.  <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/95004\">#95004</a> is supposed to fix that.<br>\nIn the mean time, you can proceed with steps 2, 3 and 4, leaving the sorting where it is.  If there is a modification in the ordering of diagnostics, we will have to revise that position, or advance faster on <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/95004\">#95004</a>.</p>",
