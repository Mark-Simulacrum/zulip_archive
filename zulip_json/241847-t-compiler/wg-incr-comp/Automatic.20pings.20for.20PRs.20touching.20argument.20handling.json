While this wouldn't necessarily lead to an ICE, it was not intended by the author, and someone unfamiliar with the incremental compilation infrastructure would not have noticed.</p>\n<p>I'm going to add myself to <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/highfive/blob/d56ba3783390296da83a1d4c6201171568271c75/highfive/configs/rust-lang/rust.json\">https://github.com/rust-lang/highfive/blob/d56ba3783390296da83a1d4c6201171568271c75/highfive/configs/rust-lang/rust.json</a> to get pinged for <code>rustc_session/src/{options.rs, config.rs}</code>, since they don't obviously deal with incremental compilation. Does anyone else want to get added (or should we potentially ping the wg Github team)?</p>",
