So an actual design document would be great. I think in order to come up with a good design, it would make sense to strive for (1) documenting how macro expansion and name resolution (should) work, (2) getting the data structures (i.e. the things ending up as query results) right, and from there (3) come up with a way of formulating a querified implementation of the two. I have a gut feeling that (for historical reasons) hygiene, macro expansion, and handling of spans are more entangled than they need to be.</p>",
