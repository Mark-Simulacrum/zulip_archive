Has anyone else had a look and could provide a starting point (I'm happy to do the reading if I can find some papers <em>to</em> read)?</p>\n<p>I created a group on <a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/groups/2533867/rust-wg-incr-comp\">Zotero</a> that has some thoughts on one or two papers that I did look at. Let me know if you want added to that.</p>",
