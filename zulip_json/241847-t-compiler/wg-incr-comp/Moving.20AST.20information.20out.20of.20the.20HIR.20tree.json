This turns to be a larger change than initially thought, so I need some design help.</p>\n<p>I submitted <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79519\">#79519</a> last week, doing essentially the same thing with <code>[Attribute]</code> leaves. It is an opportunity to evaluate the basic idea on a smaller problem. It shows a reduction in the HIR invalidation for incremental tests. Perf is pending.</p>\n<p>Completing the initial plan of removing <code>Span</code>s additionally requires to remove <code>Ident</code>s from the HIR. However, this is a much more risky operation, since <code>Ident</code>s are used for hygienic comparisons and pretty-printing. One possibility would be to introduce a new <code>hir::Ident</code> struct with carefully chosen content. What do you recommend?</p>\n<p>Last point: it is not possible to measure perf gains before having completely removed <code>Ident</code> and <code>Span</code> from HIR, so design iterations discussions are difficult.</p>",

The code base is quite a lot easier to work with than rustc.</p>",
