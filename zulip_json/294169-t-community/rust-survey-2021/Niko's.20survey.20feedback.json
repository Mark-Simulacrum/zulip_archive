I like your point about finding out what Rust is good for. We can certainly do better, but I think that PR is a good first step. I'll add an issue for this.</li>\n<li>Onboarding time is tough to measure. Even two people with the same background make take wildly different amounts of calendar time to onboard simply due to one being able to dedicate more time vs the other to the learning process. I <em>think</em> what we want to know here is about effort. What aspects of Rust took the most effort to learn. This will also differ between those who learned Rust 5 years ago vs more recently, but luckily we're much more prepared to do cohort analysis on this type now. </li>\n<li>re: asking people why they stopped using Rust - we removed this question because it was in our opinion extremely hard to figure out how representative a sample of ex-Rust users the survey takers would be. While we can never be fully sure of representativeness of our survey, ex-users who take the survey are less likely to be representative than current users who take the survey.</li>\n</ul>",
