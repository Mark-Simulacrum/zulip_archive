Given y'all have worked on surveys in the past, can you please take a look at <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/surveys/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ablocking\">open blocking issues</a> and/or the survey as <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/surveys/blob/main/surveys/2021-annual-survey/questions.md\">as a whole</a>. </p>\n<p>Would any of you be available to discuss some the issues in a synchronous meeting? Any help would be much appreciated!!!</p>",
