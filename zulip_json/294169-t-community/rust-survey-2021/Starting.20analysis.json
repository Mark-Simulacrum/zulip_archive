Some questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do we need to wait on free form answers to be translated before starting analysis? (my opinion: no)</li>\n<li>Do we want to just wait until January to turn off the survey collection even though we communicated the 22nd of Dec? (my opinion: yes)</li>\n<li>Do we want to exclusively focus on the public blog post contents or try to do general analysis and then pull out a blog post from the general analysis? (my opinion: do general analysis)</li>\n</ul>",
