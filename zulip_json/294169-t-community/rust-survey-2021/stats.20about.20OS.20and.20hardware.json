I don't think the results were mentioned in the survey results blog post, but may have missed it elsewhere ? (sorry if that's the case and the data is already available)</p>\n<p>In particular, we'd be interested in knowing more about how popular osx and windows were (in general or compared to last year), to see if target-specific work there, like trying to enable PGO, would be interesting ?</p>\n<p>thanks a bunch in advance</p>",
