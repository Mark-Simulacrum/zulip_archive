        "content": "<p>So, my .2 cents on the matter:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Translating the survey <strong>questions</strong> is not the problem. I think that we (as in \"we volunteers\") can do it ourselves starting from last year's questionnaire + the delta of additional work. Though we ended up observing that survey questions in different languages were misaligned. The idea of adding some machinery to automate the survey generation aired (<a href=\"#narrow/stream/249854-t-community.2Frust-survey-2020/topic/time.20to.20start.20thinking.20about.20this.20again.2E.2E.2E/near/204894258\">I did some research</a>) but due to lack of time nothing was really investigated/implemented. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"215333\">@Florian Gilcher</span> I think Pontoon could be tested for this part. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The tricky part is translating <strong>answers</strong>. Fixed form answers (yes/no, multiple choice) are out of the way with some copy&amp;paste. Free-form answers otoh might end up being only partially machine translatable; the human reviewer would end up re-doing the work because a machine lacks context of what we're talking about, about any lingo, short forms, acronyms, references to people, facts, etc. For this task Pontoon is imo not suitable unless we can have a workflow to easily import &amp;&amp; export from Pontoon.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

        "content": "<p>Also for answers, we're dealing with potentially private data. We don't want to expose people's answers to literally everyone (otherwise we'd need to update our privacy policy). So we're still going to need a different policy for translating free form answers. I do wonder if machine translation first + human review is the right way to go. We're not dealing with carefully crafted marketing messages or app instructions that need to be perfect. We just want to ensure that those doing analysis and don't speak a particular language get the right idea.</p>",
