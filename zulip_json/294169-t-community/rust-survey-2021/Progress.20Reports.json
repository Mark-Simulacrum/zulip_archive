One topic we talked about is how we can work better given we're highly distributed (with me in Europe, Nick in New Zealand, and you in the States). One thing we can try is each day writing a very short summary in the morning of what what we hope to accomplish for the day and in the evening what we've actually accomplished (1 or 2 sentences each). This would include days where we don't plan or have not accomplished anything (weekends we can assume people are not working).</p>",
