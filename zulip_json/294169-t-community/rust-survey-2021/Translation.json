For example, for communication channels, since Discord is totally unavailable, Zulip and Github are partially unavailable in China. The major instant-communication choices will be QQ, Wechat and Lark. It's ok to leave the unavailable options in the survey, but be sure to add the major options :)</p>",

Also, we shouldn't assume things like that - I use WeChat and I'm outside China, and I'm sure some people in China are using Discord - the GFW is pretty permeable if you have the inclination :-) However, you are correct that we should not limit our answers to the English language defaults.</p>",
