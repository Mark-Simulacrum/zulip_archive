Essentially, our top picks right now are surveymonkey and surveyhero, but we're under the impression that both are blocked in China.

My guess is that surveymonkey gets resolved to different data centers like AWS HK and JP, where many IPs may have been blocked for being used as VPN in the past, so although it's not blocked, it may be affected if its IPs accidentally hit those, while surveyhero gets resolved to Ireland consistently, IPs of which are very unlikely to be blocked for this reason (because it's too far from China).</p>",
