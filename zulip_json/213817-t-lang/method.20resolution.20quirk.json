Not sure if this is the right place (there doesn't seem to be a stream for the 2021 edition) but I've opened an issue¹ a while ago about surprising method resolution in a corner case that then got tagged and somebody gave it a thumbs up, then nothing else having happened. </p>\n<p>Now this seems like the kind of thing that would only be fixed as part of an edition if at all, so that's why I'm here, to get some more eyes on this and figure out whether it could be fixed with next year's edition.</p>\n<p>¹ <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/68826\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/68826</a></p>",
