IIRC, this is just from an over-abundance of caution and there is no  reason that we shouldn't be able to use explicit types for proper generics (i.e., not impl Trait ones). Is this possible to change? It can be a pretty annoying papercut since there is no workaround if the function with mixed generics/impl Trait is upstream.</p>",
