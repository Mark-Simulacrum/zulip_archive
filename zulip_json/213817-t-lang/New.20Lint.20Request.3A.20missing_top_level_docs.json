        "content": "<p>(name to be bikeshed)</p>\n<p>What I'd like is a way to signal that I want to require docs on modules / types / functions, without having to put docs on every individual field and every individual enum branch. Yes, there's <code>allow(missing_docs)</code> but then you have to put it on every single type you write. If you're making a lot of structs, that becomes bothersome. It seems like this should be a simple thing to set once and have the compiler know what you mean.</p>\n<p>This could also arguably be a new way to use the existing <code>missing_docs</code> lint. Something like:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"cp\">#![deny(missing_docs(top_level))]</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Again, \"name to be bikeshed\".</p>",
