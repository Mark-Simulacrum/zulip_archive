According to the spec, when applied to definitions (rather than declarations), it's supposed to just mean that the function's ABI is explicitly specified. For blocks of declarations, it means the functions are \"imported\". I think it would be clearer for the function definition keyword to be something like <code>abi</code>. </p>\n<p>Also, <code>no_mangle</code> functions are automatically made public and added to the global symbol table in ELF, even without additional annotations. (This is possibly a bug.) This is probably what most users would expect from the <code>extern</code> keyword. If we keep the <code>extern</code> keyword instead of switching to <code>abi</code>, maybe it would be good for it to automatically have this \"automatically public and linkable\" effect.</p>",
