I've even had people in that situation tell me this is why they can't use libraries of mine in the past (rusqlite in particular) — I view it kinda like avoiding proc macros for to make build slightly easier on folks using static/musl systems — untenable for anything big, but nice if you can manage it for small stuff¹.</p>\n<p>Using macro_rules_attribute for this is clever, but doesn't easily allow you to use it in cases where you negate the condition/use it with <code>any</code>, ... which is actually needed often IME.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>¹ Similarly, I don't really care enough about these weirder use cases to actually test on them — just enough to not deliberately break them if I can avoid it. Also, all other things being equal, builds that do not include a <a href=\"http://build.rs\">build.rs</a> (or a proc macro) will be faster than ones that do, and reasoning about security is slightly easier if you don't run arbitrary code at build-time.</p>\n<p>It also helps that I can usually assume that the end result of me doing something like this via <a href=\"http://build.rs\">build.rs</a> would end up taking more code/time spent than it would save, although perhaps this isn't true if <code>cfg_aliases</code> is used (which I wasn't aware of, so thanks for the reference), and also likely isn't true for the proc macro case.</p>",
