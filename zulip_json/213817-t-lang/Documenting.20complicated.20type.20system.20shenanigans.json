I think that the appearance of the method signatures of these functions in docs is a thing that we should take seriously. Especially given that \"take a look at all the methods that are implemented on <code>Iterator</code>, <code>Option</code>, and <code>Result</code>, you'll need them\" is a common piece of advice given to beginners, the clarity of these method signatures gradually degrading as we allow more and more generalization using fancy new APIs and type system tricks is a real problem. The <code>try_find</code> method is a good example of this, but if we have to start adding higher kinded lifetime bounds to make GATs and Iterators play nice, I'm worried about similar looking signatures there.</p>\n<p>Maybe this is more of a rustdoc/T-Libs issue than a T-Lang issue (and certainly there are other things involved, like IDEs), but I do think that this needs to be a part of the feature design. I also do have a couple ideas as to how this could be addressed from the documentation PoV, but they're not great. In any case I did at least want to explicitly file a \"concern\" about this</p>",

I'm not sure if the solution is cleverer docs, better type signatures (using an alias or something?), or a language feature or some combination, but I think it is a problem worth solving since it affects beginners and it affects experienced users who still need to click through a link and mentally substitute type parameters to figure out what a function is doing.</p>",

As a matter of fact, I think \"can people that do not want to deal with GATs avoid them\" might even be a pretty good measure of how successfully we have addressed the concerns in this thread</p>",
