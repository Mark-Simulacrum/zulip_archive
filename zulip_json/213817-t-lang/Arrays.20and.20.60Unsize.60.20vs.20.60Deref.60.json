Because of that, <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.array.html\">https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.array.html</a> doesn't list the slice methods, and <code>Unsize</code> isn't mentioned at all.</p>\n<p>Now that we have const generics, I think we could have it be <code>Deref</code> as well.  Should it?</p>",
