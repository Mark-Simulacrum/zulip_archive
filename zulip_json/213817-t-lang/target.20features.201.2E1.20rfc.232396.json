Looking at the list of \"Unresolved Questions\", I would put those more in the category of \"future work\". In other words, they are not things that must be resolved prior to <strong>stabilization</strong>, but more like possible future directions. Do you object to me editing the RFC to update the headings?</p>\n<p>Also, regarding implementation, do you think you could help to guide someone who wanted to implement this RFC, or are you insufficiently familiar with those parts of the compiler? (In other words, I know you'd be around/willing to help discuss interesting questions that arise in how things ought to work, but are you also able to guide someone in the implementation process itself?)</p>\n<p>Finally, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"239881\">@Josh Triplett</span>, how would you feel about being the designated \"lang team liaison\"? I'm semi-inventing some process here but I thought it'd be good to indicate on the tracking issue who the shepherds/liaisons are. This feature doesn't seem to merit a <strong>project group</strong> but I think the concept still applies.</p>",

Maybe we can \"get by\" with the lang team liaison being someone like <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116118\">@Matthew Jasper</span> who may be a good fit for some of the impl work as well? They attend many lang team meetings today I think too.</p>",
