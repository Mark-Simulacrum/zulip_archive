I have a small idea for an improvement to declarative macros.  @dtolnay said I should post here to see if there is any merit in proceeding further.<br>\nThe idea is to add a way to find out the number of repetitions of a metavar in declarative macros, something I've needed to do a few times in the past.  I've started writing a pre-RFC at <a href=\"https://github.com/markbt/rfcs/blob/macro_repetition_count/text/0000-macro-repetition-count.md\">https://github.com/markbt/rfcs/blob/macro_repetition_count/text/0000-macro-repetition-count.md</a> explaining the rationale and what it would look like.<br>\nDoes this seem worth pursuing? I think it's fairly low effort to add (I already have a working prototype) but would be quite useful.</p>",
