That sort of makes sense, given that the lang team covers a narrower set of decisions than many teams, and conversely the language tends to be very complex and require a lot of skill to think about. </p>\n<p>But then I was looking at the teams repository, and it seems that in the last few years (as far as the history in the repository goes), the lang team has lost several members, but not added any. Unless I'm missing something. That's fairly unusual, as far as I know. Most teams seem to add new members from time to time.</p>\n<p>I was curious if there was some reason for things being this way. Certainly y'all can't be drowning in qualified applicants, but I'd think some of the leads on lang initiatives might be, for instance?</p>",
