I'm all in favor. I'm wondering if we want to use next week's slot (July 22) for this (instead of <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/25\">lang-team#25</a>) or if we would rather schedule the meeting for July 29th.</p>\n<p>One other question is whether it would be possible for <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"121053\">@varkor</span>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"216206\">@lcnr</span>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"119009\">@eddyb</span> or other \"core const generics hackers\" to attend.</p>\n<p>The design meetings take place at 13:00 UTC-04:00 (i.e., 19:00 CEST).</p>",
