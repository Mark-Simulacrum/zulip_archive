Though I'd personally still be in favour of simply disambiguating in favour of generic arguments, and losing LL(k), this has obviously caused some contention in the past: if we could avoid this, while removing the syntax papercut, that would be a win. As far as I can tell, there <em>is</em> another approach that addresses both the undesirable <code>::</code> and retains LL(k) parsing. (Of course, it has some downsides of its own, but I feel these are outweighed by the benefits.) It could well be this was suggested in the past, though I wasn't able to find record of it. I believe it's become more viable recently, though.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The idea is to differentiate <code>a &lt;</code> and <code>a&lt;</code> as a comparison, and const arguments, respectively. That is: generic arguments and comparisons are disambiguated by leading whitespace.<br>\nThere are several considerations here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Readability is likely the main one. There are two aspects: if someone deliberately formats their code without whitespace, and if someone accidentally forgets to include whitespace. I should hope that the former case is relatively rare (especially with rustfmt gaining widespread use), though the latter is very reasonable. However, as has been discussed previously with regards to this topic, the situation where an expression can successfully parse as both a comparison and a generic argument is extremely rare (there are two synthetic examples, but I don't see these happening in practice for reasons I can elaborate on). This means a missing/extra space would be an error in almost all cases, allowing us to emit custom diagnostics, which will make the problem very clear to the user.</li>\n<li>Rust prefers to be whitespace agnostic. This is true to a large extent, but it is not always the case. There are <a href=\"#narrow/stream/213817-t-lang/topic/whitespace.20sensitivity.20with.20symbols/near/212930494\">several situations</a> where whitespace vs no whitespace lead to different (valid) parses. In theory, we would be treating <code>IDENT&lt;</code> as a single token. It's fair to say this case of whitespace-sensitivity would be more commonly encountered than the existing ones, but I think this would still be relatively rare in practice.</li>\n<li>This approach is unambiguous and keeps Rust's finite lookahead, which was/is the main point of contention with the previous proposal.</li>\n<li>We could rustfix existing incorrect formatting for a new edition, so there aren't any issues with compatibility. Making this change along with a new edition seems plausible.</li>\n</ul>",
