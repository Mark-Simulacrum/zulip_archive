Note that you can do all kinds of interesting views, too, and where applicable it links to people's repositories. I'm going to update the <a href=\"http://lang-team.rust-lang.org\">lang-team.rust-lang.org</a> to point at that and also to explain how the labels and things are meant to be, but I'd love if people would cast an eye and note anything that's missing!</p>",
