(See <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/macros-by-example.html#scoping-exporting-and-importing\">https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/macros-by-example.html#scoping-exporting-and-importing</a> for details on macro scoping.) As part of that transition, we'd like to introduce visibility modifiers on macros (<code>pub macro_rules!</code>, <code>pub(crate) macro_rules!</code>, <code>pub(self) macro_rules!</code>, etc), and have any macro with a visibility modifier use path-based scoping by default. We can later use an edition boundary to change the behavior of <code>macro_rules!</code> macros without a visibility modifier, to make them private with path-based scoping as if written <code>pub(self) macro_rules!</code>.</p>",
