This is a noob question cross-posted from #general on the advice of people in that channel.</p>\n<p>What's the status of proposals to add a Golang-like struct embedding / delegation feature to Rust? By this I mean something akin to what's described in this Shepmaster stackoverflow answer <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/32552698\">https://stackoverflow.com/a/32552698</a> . Discussion I find on the internet is all several years old and it seems the topic has become dormant. I often find myself wishing Rust has this feature. Quoting Shepmaster from the above link:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>However, I do hold out hope for a language feature that enables succinct _delegation_, reducing the annoyance of composition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here's the RFC tracking issue from 2018 <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2393\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2393</a></p>",
