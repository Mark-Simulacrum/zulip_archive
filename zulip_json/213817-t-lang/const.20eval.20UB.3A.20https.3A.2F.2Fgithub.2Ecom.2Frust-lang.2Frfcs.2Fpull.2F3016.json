You need to distinguish \"statically detectable UB\" (look at the code and say if running that code will cause UB) from \"dynamically detectable UB\" (run the code in Miri/UBsan-like situations and check for all UB). Obviously, dynamic detection is much much easier than static detection. So there is a lot of trivial-to-detect UB during CTFE that will never get eliminated during a dead-code-elim pass.</p>",
