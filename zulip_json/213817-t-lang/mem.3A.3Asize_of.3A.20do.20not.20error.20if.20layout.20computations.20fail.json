Emitting a panic for that is a little bit like how promotion handles panics. There's an assertion before getting to the uncomputable promoted constant, so we never reach the invalid code. Basically this would make a <code>size_of::&lt;T&gt;()</code> invocation <code>{assert!(well_formed_for_value&lt;T&gt;()); actual_size_of&lt;T&gt;()}</code>. But in contrast to promotion, right now <code>size_of</code> is something that is known to happen at compile time, so it's like a constant, thus we emit a compile-time error if we fail to evaluate it. So basically any use of <code>size_of::&lt;T&gt;()</code> technically requires a <code>where const size_of::&lt;T&gt;()</code> bound on all functions using <code>size_of::&lt;T&gt;()</code> without a concrete <code>T</code>. Now this would be very invasive, so we could autogenerate such bounds <em>just</em> for the <code>size_of</code> case. Though I have been informed that this may not actually be feasible. With such autogenerated bounds, we'd get better errors again</p>",
