I think ideal would be to try and truly transcribe what folks are saying, but I think it'd also be reasonable to capture key points, whatever the conclusion is, and to link into the video of the discussion.</p>\n<p>(That said, in my attempts to do those sorts of summaries, I often find it's kind of hard because it requires 'real time' editorial judgement about how important things are, and that's often more obvious after the fact.)</p>\n<p>Anyway, this is all to say, I'm wondering about the idea of trying to start up a little group of folks who might trade off minute taking duties and try to help increase lang team transparency and visibility?</p>",
