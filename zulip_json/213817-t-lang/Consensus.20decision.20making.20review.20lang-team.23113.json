I put a slew of review comments, and if you want, I can just do the edits for them and merge it. But I had one question that I could not answer: The use of potential synonyms “mutable” ~ “reversible and “immutable” ~ “irreversible” … So I do not want to merge it until that main question is addressed.</p>",
