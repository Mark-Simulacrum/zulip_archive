It basically proposes a lint exactly like <code>#[must_use]</code> called <code>#[must_not_await]</code> for designating values that should not be live across an await point. <span class=\"user-group-mention\" data-user-group-id=\"1977\">@T-lang</span> I think this RFC is more-or-less ready to be opened, but wanting to request feedback from folks before doing so.</p>\n<p>To me the biggest unresolved question is also an unresolved question for <code>#[must_use]</code>, and ought to be handled together: how much do we care about \"must-use\" (or \"must-not-await\") structs that are embedded within other structs?</p>",
