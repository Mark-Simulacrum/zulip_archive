As far as I understand, there is no (?) type alias rfc (I would appreciate pointers in its direction if there is) and rust reference just talks about aliases, with no mention of the bounds. Is it something that was supposed to be there from the begging or were you exploring the possible design space for the excessive bounds. If it's the latter, am I correct in that that change would warrant an rfc?</p>",
