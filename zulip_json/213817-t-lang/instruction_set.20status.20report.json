        "content": "<p>I've been catching up on the T-lang meetings, and <code>#[instruction_set(?)]</code> has been on the agenda with no info for a month or two, apparently. Here's the story.</p>\n<p>The thing with the <code>#[instruction_set(?)]</code> attribute is that the way rustc passes this to LLVM it is that it sets or unsets a target feature attribute on the individual function (<code>thumb</code>, in the case of ARM, I'm not sure the MIPS name). This is <em>similar to</em> the <code>#[target_feature(enable=\"foo\")]</code> attribute on a function. The primary difference is that <code>instruction_set</code> can enable or <em>disable</em> a target feature, and the normal <code>target_feature</code> attribute can only enable target features.</p>\n<p>So this brings us to all the fun with cross-feature function calls.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>LLVM <em>will not</em> inline a function across an \"incompatible\" target feature barrier.<ul>\n<li>If you have function <code>a()</code> that uses <code>avx</code> and function <code>s()</code> that uses <code>sse</code>, then <code>s()</code> can be inlined into <code>a()</code>, but <code>a()</code> cannot be inlined into <code>s()</code>.</li>\n<li>On ARM, having <code>thumb</code> either on <strong>or</strong> off is incompatible with the opposite state.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Actaully I just lied to you a bit because <code>inline(always)</code>, which maps to <code>forceinline</code> in LLVM, apparently can actually <em>force</em> the inline to happen, even across a feature barrier.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So <em>when</em> does this matter? Well, sometimes, but not always:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If your function body is just rust code, then that code could naturally have worked in either instruciton_set.</li>\n<li>If your funciton body is inline assembly which is written for A but then gets inlined into a funciton using T, then you're kinda hosed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So that's one concrete problem: <strong>instruction_set and inline assembly behave badly in the presence of inline(always)</strong></p>\n<p>(Note: of course, inline assembly is unsafe and so this isn't a <em>soundness</em> issue, it's just a <em>footgun</em> issue)</p>\n<p>But here's the other problem, which is actually possibly just as much of an issue: remember how rust has all these \"zero cost\" abstractions that rust loves? like iterators? and smart pointers? and stuff like that? that stuff all depends on functions that get inlined. But when <code>core</code> and the rest of the program are being compiled using one instruction set, and then your little alternate instruciton set function is being compiled using another instruction set, then your little alternate instruction set function can't inline anything into itself. Even a single volatile access is a function call to the volatile method, then the single access instrction, and then that returns. Runtime performance falls into a deep, deep hole in the ground, worse than the worst debug performance you've ever faced. Which is not... <em>wrong</em> exactly, it's not <em>unsound</em>, but it is <em>very bad</em>.</p>\n<p>And you can \"fix\" this by making your instruction_set function with an alternate instruction set immediately just call to whatever other fuction written in the default instruction set for the program. However, that's... rather limiting and unfortunate.</p>\n<p>So that's the other concrete problem: <strong>instruction_set has poor runtime performance in the absence of either inline(always) or inline assembly</strong></p>\n<p>And that's the status report.</p>",

At present, you can:<br>\n, immediately jump to a default instruction set function<br>\n, immediately use inline assembly<br>\n, take a massive performance hit because you get absolutely no inlines and rust relies on inlines more than you'd think.</p>\n<p>So my proposal for a possible way to fix it is to have <code>asm!</code> and <code>instruction_set</code> both \"lock\" a function to only one particular instruction set, and all other functions are \"any instruction set\" by default. Then when inlining rustc can inline an \"any\" function to either specific instruction set. Does this sound reasonable?</p>\n<p>Or, maybe put another way: if a non-default instruction set function calls a default instruction set function, and the inline data is available, rustc generates llvm ir for the function twice, once with default instruction set attributes and once with the non-default instruction set attributes. This would need to happen all the way down the call stack as long as inline data is available. Then llvm's normal compilation mechanisms would be able to handle the rest.</p>",
