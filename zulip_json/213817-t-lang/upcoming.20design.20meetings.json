We have two pending meeting proposals, both opened by me:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>lang team path to membership and MCP procedure <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/32\">rust-lang/lang-team#32</a> </li>\n<li>Discuss WF checks and type aliases <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/25\">rust-lang/lang-team#25</a> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'd like to propose that we schedule the first one for <strong>this coming Wednesday</strong>, unless folks think that is maybe too short notice, and we should start from next week? I'm amenable to that.</p>",
