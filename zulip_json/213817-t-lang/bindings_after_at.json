The MIRI part was just that I'm not sure how the code is written to read out the field -- if it's matched against a <code>&amp;mut</code> we'd of course need to make sure it either read out the field before making the <code>&amp;mut</code> from the <code>@</code>, or to read the copy field through the new <code>&amp;mut</code>.  I don't know if that happens today.  (And maybe MIR borrowck finds it fine and we wouldn't need the MIRI UB check to find it.)</p>",
