We need the 2021 edition to help us apply that to <code>panic!</code>, because historically one-argument panic has worked differently (supporting an arbitrary value), and <code>panic!(\"{local_variable\"}\")</code> looks like a one-argument panic.</p>\n<p>Do we want to stabilize support for this in everything <em>except</em> <code>panic!</code> in all editions, and let panic be inconsistent in Rust 2018 code? Or do we want to stabilize it only in 2021 and newer, for consistency? I've been assuming the former (stabilize in all editions), but I wanted to check that we had consensus on that.</p>",
