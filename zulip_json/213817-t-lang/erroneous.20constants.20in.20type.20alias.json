It reports lints and not hard errors. Unfortunately, if those bounds mention arrays, and the length of the array fails to compute (<code>1/0</code> or sth else that is guaranteed to fail), then we still report a hard error.</p>\n<p>The lang team decision on that PR was to not make invalid bounds a hard error, but erroneous constants were never touched. <span class=\"user-group-mention\" data-user-group-id=\"1916\">@WG-const-eval</span> would prefer if we just made them hard errors. Considering that there were no instances on crater that actually had erroneous constants in wf-bounds, how do you (<span class=\"user-group-mention\" data-user-group-id=\"1977\">@T-lang</span>) feel about this?</p>\n<p>cc <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"119031\">@Esteban KÃ¼ber</span> (PR author)</p>",
