While that is probably the common case, existential lifetimes are strictly more powerful -- in particular, in the context of <a href=\"http://plv.mpi-sws.org/rustbelt/ghostcell/\"><code>GhostCell</code></a>, the type <code>âˆƒ 'id, (GhostToken&lt;'id&gt;, GhostCell&lt;'id, T&gt;</code> would be a really useful one, and this cannot be expressed with \"borrows of a field\". <a href=\"https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/FP/ghostcell/-/issues/3\">https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/FP/ghostcell/-/issues/3</a> also brings up a usecase where this could help.</p>\n<p>I don't remember where Niko said this though, so I'm just throwing this out there in the hope it can become part of the discussion. ;)</p>",
