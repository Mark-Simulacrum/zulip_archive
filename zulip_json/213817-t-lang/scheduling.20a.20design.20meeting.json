I'm not sure if this is just \"need reminders\" or if this is a \"not sure if I can deal with a 2nd meeting\" (which is a concern of mine). I'm open to \"we don't have time for two meetings\" -- but I would definitely like to talk out how we should be having longer conversatiosn (and maybe some of the other goals).</p>",
