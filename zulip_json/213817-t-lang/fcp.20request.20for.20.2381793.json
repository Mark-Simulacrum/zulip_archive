I nominated the issue more than a month ago but afaict it was never reached in a triage meeting. As I assume this to be both fairly trivial and uncontroversial, is it possible to deal with this outside of a <span class=\"user-group-mention\" data-user-group-id=\"1977\">@T-lang</span>  meeting and start an fcp?</p>",
