The <code>let</code> binding grammar would then be <code>let &lt;pat_param&gt; $(: &lt;ty&gt;)? = &lt;expr&gt;;</code></p>\n<p>Thus, on top of the macro improvement (I repeat this because it can be extremely frustrating to have subpar support for closures and function defs in <code>macro_rules!</code> macros just because of this), it would deny things such as <code>let x: u64: u64</code> (it would allow <code>let (x: u64): u64</code>, but that one seems way more reasonable already).</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Now the only remaining question would be the case of <code>ref mut out @ None</code> (a pattern I, and other people, may have written so as to ensure <code>*out = Some(…);</code> is a set and not a replace operation) <em>w.r.t.</em> these ascriptions? Which should it be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>ref mut out: Option&lt;T&gt; @ None</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>ref mut out @ None: Option&lt;T&gt;</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Neither: the type-ascripted binder would not be compatible with <code>@</code> currently. In that case, would smth like <code>(ref mut out: Option&lt;T&gt;) @ None</code> be allowed? That is, should the <code>Identifier</code> pattern be changed to take a <code>Binder</code> pattern before the <code>@</code>, and that <code>Binder</code> pattern would then be <code>ref? mut? &lt;ident&gt; (: &lt;ty&gt;)?</code></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I haven't looked into the details of these grammar changes I'm suggesting (the <code>PatParam</code> <em>vs.</em> <code>NestedPat</code> distinction may yield a slightly cumbersome grammar definition), but it looks doable in a retro-compatible fashion.</p>",

I like that if it's on a binding, we can say that that's definitely the type of the binding, the same way it is on a normal <code>let x: Ty</code>.  Whereas <code>Foo(x): &amp;mut Foo</code> feels weird to me as a sub-pattern.  (But I guess it's already a bit weird to annotate like that at the top level, so maybe that ship has sailed.  Not that I ever see people write code that looks like that.)</p>\n<p>The only time you can't annotate the binding is for something which there's a phantom type parameter, but all the places I've ever wanted this haven't been phantom.</p>\n<p>Notably your example doesn't actually annotate anything meaningful -- or, at least, it wouldn't if &lt;<a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/76342\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/76342</a>&gt; were fixed.  And I think <code>([x_0: i32, y_0], [x_1: i32, y_0])</code> is a fine way to annotate arrays.</p>",
