I was thinking though that as are starting to go forward with chartering project groups, it's definitely a good idea for us to also be looking over pending RFCs -- in particular, I would like us to be sure that we are chartering the <em>right</em> groups (i.e., if there are 4 good options, maybe one is clearly the <em>best</em> use of group time). I think right now we have a bit of a \"local view\".</p>",
