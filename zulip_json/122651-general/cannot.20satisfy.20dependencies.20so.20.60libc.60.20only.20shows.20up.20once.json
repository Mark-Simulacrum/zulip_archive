As Bjorn explained in PM, I can restructure my repo so that only one dylib imports <code>libc</code> (the others would declare it <code>extern</code>), but there's not guarantee that I wouldn't see the same again for another dep later down the line. </p>\n<p>It looks like it would be better if I made just one of my workspace crates a <code>cdylib</code> and have the rest as rlibs. This means moving all of the exported C ABI functions to the sole <code>cdylib</code> crate...</p>",
