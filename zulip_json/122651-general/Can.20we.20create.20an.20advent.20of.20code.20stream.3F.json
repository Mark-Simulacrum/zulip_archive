        "content": "<p>Thanks for sharing the link to the discord. We have a Julia zulip advent of code stream, and it's better than slack and discord (imo) because 1) we can have discussions for each day, and 2) it allows much more richer discussion options (LaTeX for example). It's also easier to find solutions from last year's advent of code discussion on the Julia zulip stream. I've attached a few of screenshots as an example:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/4715/PxJYKJboIQfjNxSKMIly9Anz/Screen-Shot-2021-12-07-at-9.24.28-AM.png\">Screen-Shot-2021-12-07-at-9.24.28-AM.png</a> </p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/4715/PxJYKJboIQfjNxSKMIly9Anz/Screen-Shot-2021-12-07-at-9.24.28-AM.png\" title=\"Screen-Shot-2021-12-07-at-9.24.28-AM.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/4715/PxJYKJboIQfjNxSKMIly9Anz/Screen-Shot-2021-12-07-at-9.24.28-AM.png\"></a></div><p><a href=\"/user_uploads/4715/QKY3Y5oTbjywKoEacLaTjwc9/Screen-Shot-2021-12-07-at-9.22.54-AM.png\">Screen-Shot-2021-12-07-at-9.22.54-AM.png</a> </p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/4715/QKY3Y5oTbjywKoEacLaTjwc9/Screen-Shot-2021-12-07-at-9.22.54-AM.png\" title=\"Screen-Shot-2021-12-07-at-9.22.54-AM.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/4715/QKY3Y5oTbjywKoEacLaTjwc9/Screen-Shot-2021-12-07-at-9.22.54-AM.png\"></a></div><p><a href=\"/user_uploads/4715/qvPl2X75rLEIgGJjgf_MUiC2/Screen-Shot-2021-12-07-at-9.27.29-AM.png\">Screen-Shot-2021-12-07-at-9.27.29-AM.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/4715/qvPl2X75rLEIgGJjgf_MUiC2/Screen-Shot-2021-12-07-at-9.27.29-AM.png\" title=\"Screen-Shot-2021-12-07-at-9.27.29-AM.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/4715/qvPl2X75rLEIgGJjgf_MUiC2/Screen-Shot-2021-12-07-at-9.27.29-AM.png\"></a></div>",

It's not that users are unwelcome here, it's just not optimized for them. Creating things for AoC would be a type of that optimization, which is why I don't think it's appropriate.</p>",
