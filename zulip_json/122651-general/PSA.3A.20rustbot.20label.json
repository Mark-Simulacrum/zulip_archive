For example I quite like people using the bot to switch a PR between waiting-for-author and waiting-for-review, because it sends a notification. But the bot invocation for this is quite long, so I tend to just change the labels via GH's UI so I do not have to type the label names.<br>\nMaybe there could be something like <code>@rustbot status=waiting-for-author</code> or just <code>@rustbot waiting-for-author</code> or so, that cleans the old status flag and sets the new one? Figuring out which ones to clear could be tricky though.</p>",
