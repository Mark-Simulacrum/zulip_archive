As I have seen it, most projects do not use clippy, and meny that do configure it inline, like <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/master/src/cargo/lib.rs#L5-L31\">https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/master/src/cargo/lib.rs#L5-L31</a><br>\nSo I don't know that not having a <code>.clippy</code> means that the defaults are good.</p>",
