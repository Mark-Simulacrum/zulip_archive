Don't <code>c_char</code> values only have meaning in the 0 to 127 range anyway? So why does the sign matter?</p>\n<p>(people besides gnzlbg can also answer, i'm just pinging them since they made the statement; Also I didn't want to clog up the issue tracker with what is probably just a beginner's question)</p>",
