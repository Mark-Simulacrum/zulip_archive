There are currently no non-newlib-based 3DS toolchains, however, there are multiple for the Switch. However, for the 3DS, a pure Rust target would be feasible to implement and probably make more sense than a newlib one, it'd just be much more difficult since it couldn't share code with Unix targets. For the Switch, these toolchains exist:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DevkitA64: Made up of libnx, a heavily modified newlib fork, and a slightly modified gcc fork. I have a mostly functional Rust target for this, it'd just need some cleanup, testing, and a rebase to be upstreamed. Only supports statically linked binaries (no shared libraries or dynamically linked binaries).</li>\n<li>libtransistor: Mostly dead toolchain based on clang, some developers moved to MegatonHammer/DevkitA64.</li>\n<li>Skyline: Game modding toolkit containing a Rust toolchain dynamically linking against Nintendo's proprietary C library. Could likely be used with the official toolchain with only linking-related changes, though obviously I can't say for sure. Only supports linking shared libraries, which isn't a fundamental limitation but there isn't much interest in using Nintendo's SDK for homebrew outside game modding.</li>\n<li>MegatonHammer: Deprecated project providing a pure-Rust toolchain for the Switch. Replaced by SunriseOS's userspace toolchain.</li>\n<li>SunriseOS: WIP open source pure-Rust implementation of the Nintendo Switch kernel and toolchain, currently both targeting i386. It also includes a minimal userspace, but that exists for the primary purpose of testing the other two. While an aarch64 kernel port is a goal, it isn't an immediate one. An aarch64 port of its toolchain ABI-compatible with the official Switch kernel should hopefully happen in the relatively near future, however.Â </li>\n</ul>\n<p>I know that there is interest in upstreaming DevkitA64, Skyline, and (once complete) Sunrise targets. What are your thoughts on this?</p>",

Megaton-Hammer used the <code>aarch64-roblabla-switch</code> triple. IMO the ideal situation for the Nintendo Switch specifically would be to unify all triples under <code>aarch64-switch-&lt;environment&gt;</code>, where environment can be libnx, libtransistor, nintendo (or whatever name makes sense for nintendo's proprietary framework) and sunrise. This way, switch-specific but toolchain-independant code can be cfg'd with <code>target_os = \"switch\"</code>, while target-dependant code can use <code>target_env = \"sunrise\"</code>. </p>\n<p>FWIW though, I don't plan on ever upstreaming SunriseOS targets into rustc. I've got an OK system set up to patch my libstd modifications in (applying patches to rust-src, and using xargo to build it), and I don't think the upsides of having it in-tree would justify the maintenance burden.
