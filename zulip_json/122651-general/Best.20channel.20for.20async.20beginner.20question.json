I have found this crate <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/zbus\">https://crates.io/crates/zbus</a> . It seems this crate use async for notification. I am a beginner with this. What is the best documentation to read to quickly be proficient witrh this with Rust. I know asynchronous programmation from other languages so I am not a total beginner. I started to read async-std book <a href=\"https://book.async.rs/concepts.html\">https://book.async.rs/concepts.html</a>. It seems the backend privilieged by zbus. are there alternatives ? I am a bit lost with this.</p>",
