I need the other way around.</p>\n<p>I could probably cobble something together with <code>xtask</code>, <code>cargo make</code>,  or even just a scrip. But if there's already a solution that deals with everything (e.g. putting the build outputs into the <code>target</code> dir so they are automatically cleaned), then I'd rather use that.</p>\n<p>[I'm actually only having to do this to work around <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/84395\">this bug</a>]</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
