        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"311029\">@Luis Wirth</span>  <code>FOREIGN_SIZE</code> is indeed the correct size, but the individual fields also have certain alignment requirements. If the size of one field is not perfectly aligned with the start of the following (aligned) field, then Rust inserts some implicit padding bytes in between the fields in order to properly align the next field. A type is said to be \"inhabited\" if there exist no such implicit padding bytes and all the possible byte values are valid for the given type (the mere absence of implicit padding bytes, does not imply that all its byte values are valid! An <code>enum Example { A, B}</code> uses all its bytes, but a byte value of <code>5</code> is invalid, for example). The <a href=\"https://docs.rs/bytemuck/1.5.1/bytemuck/trait.Pod.html\">crate docs</a> for <code>Pod</code> also have some interesting things to say about this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Safety</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The type must be inhabited (eg: no Infallible).</li>\n<li>The type must allow any bit pattern (eg: no bool or char, which have illegal bit patterns).</li>\n<li>The type must not contain any padding bytes, either in the middle or on the end (eg: no #[repr(C)] struct Foo(u8, u16), which has padding in the middle, and also no #[repr(C)] struct Foo(u16, u8), which has padding on the end).<br>\n...</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note that my suggestion only checks for implicit byte padding, it doesn't ensure the type is \"fully inhabited\". You could combine it with <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"330154\">@The 8472</span> 's suggestion to also explicitly check the type of all the fields, e.g. <code>let field1: *const u64 = core::ptr::addr_of!(foreign_struct.field1)</code> in addition to the check for implicit padding and a check for a hard-coded expected size. Then manually check once that all field types are \"inhabited\". If the field type then changes (or the struct size changes if a new field is added), you will get a compile error (or a <code>#[test]</code> error in the latter case). Repeat this process for every field of the foreign struct which is not an inhabited language primitive. Unfortunately you can only ensure the types of public fields this way, if the struct has private fields, then you can't be sure that all it's values are valid (and even though a private field might be a <code>u32</code>, the invariant of the foreign type might say that it never stores anything bigger than 24 bits, for example, which also makes it invalid to assume it is inhabited). I hope I didn't make it sound too complicated, but to summarize: the foreign type must not have any implicit padding (my example checks for this), all its fields must be public, the size of the foreign type must be fixed (as part of your test) and all its fields must be of a type that is valid for every possible combination of bits (i.e. \"inhabited\").</p>",
