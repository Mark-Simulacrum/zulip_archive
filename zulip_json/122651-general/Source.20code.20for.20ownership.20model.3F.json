I don't mind reading through the code statically though. </p>\n<p>I was wondering if someone could give me a nudge about whereabouts in the source code to start? Also, if someone can point out resources that they have used to understand the internals of the implementation, that'd be swell as well (RFCs, docs, theory, I don't mind anything really). I'm planning to spend some time studying the whole thing anyway.</p>\n<p>Also, if this is not the right channel, please let me know where to post it! :-)</p>\n<p>Cheers.</p>",
