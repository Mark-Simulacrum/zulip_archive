We didn't want the anonymizer to take a \"raw\" dump and mutate it. Instead, we needed to provide an already anonymized dump, without access to real data. The configuration that determined how the real system data would be anonymized should have been kept separate from that data.</p>\n<p>We also wanted a tool that was flexible about how the anonymization itself takes place, ideally allowing the use of templates to populate field contents.</p>\n<p>Read more about Datanymizer: <a href=\"https://evrone.com/datanymizer\">https://evrone.com/datanymizer</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/4715/PNSCmbbsAqTg7-a5246U75Wi/datanymizer.png\">datanymizer.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/4715/PNSCmbbsAqTg7-a5246U75Wi/datanymizer.png\" title=\"datanymizer.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/4715/PNSCmbbsAqTg7-a5246U75Wi/datanymizer.png\"></a></div>",
