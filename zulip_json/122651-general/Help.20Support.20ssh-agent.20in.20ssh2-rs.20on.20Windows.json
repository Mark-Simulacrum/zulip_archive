The root cause of this is that libssh2 (the C library that backs ssh2-rs which is then used by Cargo, etc.) does not currently support the ssh-agent on Windows due to implementation differences between the Unix OpenSSH ssh-agent and the Windows OpenSSH ssh-agent. I have written up a <a href=\"https://github.com/libssh2/libssh2/pull/517\">PR</a> adding support for the Windows ssh-agent, but due to unfamiliarity with Windows the maintainers don't want to merge it just yet.</p>\n<p>This is where those of you reading this come in. The libssh2 maintainers would like it if more Windows devs/users could review my PR before they merge it. If you have knowledge of Windows programming in C I would appreciate if you could review my code and/or test it.</p>\n<p>Personally, I tested my changes by modifying ssh2-rs to use my PR branch and then ran a couple of simple test programs using the modified ssh2-rs. I've also patched Cargo to use my locally modified ssh2-rs and tested it by using cargo in scenarios that would have failed before, namely when checking out git repo crates over ssh.</p>\n<p>Thank you in advance to all those who review and test the changes.</p>",
