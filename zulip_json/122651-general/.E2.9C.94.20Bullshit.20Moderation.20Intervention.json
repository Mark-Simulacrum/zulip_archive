At best, the issue stays the same, but it's a strong likelihood that it will inflame the issue. It's better for the sake of expedience and fairness that issues stay between the immediately involved parties and moderators. Unless a participant is removed from the project, they are still a community member, regardless of any possible moderation actions.</p>",
