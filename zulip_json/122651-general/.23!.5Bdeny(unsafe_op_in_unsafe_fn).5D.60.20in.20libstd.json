I used ripgrep to search through sys/wasi to find all files with a mention of \"unsafe\". From there, I added #![deny(unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn)] at the top of the file, and then ran ./x.py check src/libstd to check for errors, which surprisingly resulted in a successful compile. Should I run extra checks or am I going about this the wrong way?</p>\n</blockquote>",
