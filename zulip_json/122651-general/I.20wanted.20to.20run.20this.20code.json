Now I wanted to run the example that is on the README file. Given that it is my first time seeing rust, I do not know much about what may be the problem. To be honest, I do not even know how to run the code that is in the README file. Should it be inside the main function? I am very confused, I tried to compile it several times with rustc but all sorts of errors keep showing up. Errors that do not recognize the shuttle library. However, I have already tried the flag -L to the library on the target/build folder and already tried to include the library with --extern as well and nothing seems to work. Please! Help me!</p>",
