I've posted the feedback about the pitfall we stumbled upon in our application, which is a semver hazard in proc-macro/trait symbols ambiguity.<br>\nI posted it to <a href=\"https://users.rust-lang.org/t/semver-hazard-around-proc-macro-trait-symbols-ambiguity/72178\">the users forum</a>. However, I would like the language team to take a look at this. There was a suggestion to move that discussion to the internals forum, though I am not sure. Does in make sense to continue the discussion in the users forum there? Not sure I really have the power to do this, but it is probably the domain of  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116009\">@nikomatsakis</span>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"239881\">@Josh Triplett</span>, sorry for ping guys, I hope I don't break the rules.</p>",
