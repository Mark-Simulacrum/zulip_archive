Look at what the Rust book says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Using TcpListener, we can listen for TCP connections at the address 127.0.0.1:7878. In the address, the section before the colon is an IP address representing your computer (this is the same on every computer and doesn’t represent the authors’ computer specifically), and 7878 is the port. We’ve chosen this port for two reasons: HTTP is normally accepted on this port, and 7878 is rust typed on a telephone.</p>\n</blockquote>",
