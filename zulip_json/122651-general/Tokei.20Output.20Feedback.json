For context tokei counts your files showing you how many code, comments, etc you have in a certain language. I've linked below how it currently looks and the new output. I would love to know what people think the new output means.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/XAMPPRocky/a5dcd38da6a1a83ddc8e34a8ec0502d9\">https://gist.github.com/XAMPPRocky/a5dcd38da6a1a83ddc8e34a8ec0502d9</a></p>",

We’ll see about Markdown in Rust, it’s definitely possible to count the markdown in Rust, though I’m unsure how to display that, as there’s real recursion where there’s Rust in Markdown in Rust.</p>\n<p>On the bash nit, it’s not actually counting Bash here it’s counting Shell as in the <code>.sh</code> language.</p>",
