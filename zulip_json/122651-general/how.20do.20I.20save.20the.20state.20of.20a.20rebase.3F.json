They've just happened not to write the TL,DR anywhere, and gone in great lengths to also explain how rebasing works and why that one liner works too, with added ASCII diagrams! Which is nice … but hard to skim <span aria-label=\"upside down\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f643\" role=\"img\" title=\"upside down\">:upside_down:</span> </p>\n<p>I'll just add that a pretty nifty thing to do here is to use a <code>worktree</code>: <code>git worktree add path/to/a/new/dir -b new-branch-name</code> such as, if your are at the root of the <code>rust</code> repo:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Bash\"><pre><span></span><code>git worktree add ../rust-break-ra -b rust-break-ra\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This way, your <code>rust</code> dir is still rebasing, but within that <code>rust-break-ra</code> newly created directory, you should be able to push your branch (maybe with a <code>git rebase abort</code> there, haven't tested it)</p>",
