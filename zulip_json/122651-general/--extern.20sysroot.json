The design does not seem nailed down, and since it involves multiple teams (lang, compiler, cargo) it feels like there isn't a clear path forward. Would it at least make sense to create a tracking issue where the design can be discussed? Or maybe the design is clear, and I'm just not aware? (In particular, the intersection of unstable <code>--extern</code> flag, the <code>meta</code> crate, and possible Cargo changes to support it.)</p>",
