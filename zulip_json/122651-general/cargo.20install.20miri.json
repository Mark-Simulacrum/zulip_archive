I assume we'd have to (a) enable the cargo-miri feature per default, and (b) upload miri to <a href=\"http://creates.io\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://creates.io\">creates.io</a>, and (c) re-upload it every other day to fix things for latest nightly. I have no idea how much effort the last two parts are, in particular considering that we'd likely have to re-publish fairly frequently. Can several people have publishing rights for the same crate? Do you even think we should do this?</p>",
