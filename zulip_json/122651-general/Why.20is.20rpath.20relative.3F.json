The biggest problem is that it is always relative, meaning that if the binary is moved, the rpath breaks. This is a problem because even <code>cargo build</code> will move the binary, meaning that rpath is basically useless when using cargo. (The absolute fallback path doesn't help at all, it points to a directory that does not even exist on my system.) Do you know why the rpath is relative?</p>",
