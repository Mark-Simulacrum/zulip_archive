I'm trying to get started on a new project, and working with a few things that are very new to me:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>C++</li>\n<li>vcpkg</li>\n<li>Development on Windows</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have a library (<a href=\"https://github.com/powerof3/CommonLibSSE/\">https://github.com/powerof3/CommonLibSSE/</a>) I want to link to, which relies on dependencies from vcpkg. I'm not entirely sure how to go about setting everything up so that I can bind CommonLib with cxx while making sure it and all requirements are built with vcpkg. Has anyone done something similar?</p>",
