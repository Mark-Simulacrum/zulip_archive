I want to rebase my branch (<a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74200\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74200</a>) by including the changes from the master branch (the move to <code>library/&lt;lib&gt;/src/...</code> done in <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/73265\">#73265</a>). I'm reading tutorials and the github book but I'm quite lost on how to do it without making my branches show a bazillion changes on thousands of files</p>",
