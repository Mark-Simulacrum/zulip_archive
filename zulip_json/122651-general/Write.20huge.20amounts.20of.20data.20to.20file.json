Memory mapped IO tends to be quite a mixed bag, the page faults can be more expensive than writes with large buffers, you definitely have to measure that.</p>\n<p>Optimizations beyond that point take more effort, e.g. doing the processing on multiple threads and using absolute positioned writes or using async IO APIs (very OS-specific). Separating the compute work from the IO can help too.</p>",
