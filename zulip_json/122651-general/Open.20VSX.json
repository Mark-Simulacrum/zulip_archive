I'd like to claim the matklad namespace to prevent other publishers (for example there's already a nightly/dev version that seems broken). I'm here to ask permission to do so. I have no idea who to formally ask or where!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So <a href=\"http://gitpod.io\">gitpod.io</a> runs Eclipse Theia which gets extensions from Open VSX?</p>",
