I can't find when it was added, all I know is that its (probably only) use is the inclusive range which has been superceded by ..=.</p>",

Just checked and it turns out that <code>...</code> after an expression fragment was allowed in the beginning, then got turned into a warning before being turned into a hard-error which is probably why the book had it working at first. I guess that part didn't age well. Thanks for the answer <span aria-label=\"+1\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f44d\" role=\"img\" title=\"+1\">:+1:</span></p>",
