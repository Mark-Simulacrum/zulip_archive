What happens between the stabilization issue getting merged, and the feature appearing in the next release (1.47?)? I don't see it listed on the <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md\">release notes</a> yet, even though the latest mentioned version is dated 4 days in the future so I assume the release notes accumulates entries before the actual release, so I would have expected to see it by now. Or is my count off by 6 weeks, and the stabilization means that it's going to hit beta in 4 days and stable in 6 weeks?</p>",
