After running cargo run, it outputs one line with the following: \"note: run with <code>RUST_BACKTRACE=1</code> environment variable to display a backtrace\". So, yeah, I was interested in seeing the backtrace. So I put RUST_BACKTRACE=1 in console and execute it, I checked with echo and the variable seems like it is set. However, when I run: cargo run, again, it does not seem to work. It outputs exactly the same thing. Will somebody please help me :)</p>",
