However, I have found some and according  to <a href=\"https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/conventions.html#copyright-notice\">this section</a> they should be removed. </p>\n<p>From a quick ripgrep it looks like there is <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/test/rustdoc/auxiliary/enum-primitive.rs\">this file</a> and some other with Public Domain copyright (should these copyrights be removed as well?) : <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/test/ui/closures\">for example here</a></p>\n<p>I know this might be a fringe issue, but striving for coherency is something a good repository should aim for :)</p>",
