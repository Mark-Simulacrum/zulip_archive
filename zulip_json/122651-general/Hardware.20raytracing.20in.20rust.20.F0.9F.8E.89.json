After successfully making rust on the GPU a reality, i wanted to attempt something that (from my knowledge) has not been done before, hardware raytracing on CUDA without using CUDA C++. After a lot of pain, a lot of segfaults, a lot of stack overflows, and a lot of reading internal inline assembly, i was able to successfully do hardware raytracing fully in rust (both the CPU and the GPU code). I ported my toy gpu path tracer to it as a proof of concept, and the path tracer can now do:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CPU (multithreaded),</li>\n<li>GPU,</li>\n<li>GPU (hardware)<br>\nSharing the same exact core code for the path tracing logic.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/4715/_Crivh52RXyQ4nYSpARAi8ze/Screenshot_583.png\">Screenshot_583.png</a> </p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/4715/_Crivh52RXyQ4nYSpARAi8ze/Screenshot_583.png\" title=\"Screenshot_583.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/4715/_Crivh52RXyQ4nYSpARAi8ze/Screenshot_583.png\"></a></div><p>The result is that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rust is now the only other language capable of hardware raytracing using existing CUDA pipelines.</li>\n<li>The Rust CPU code is ~250 lines shorter than an equivalent OptiX C SDK example. (200 vs 500 lines).</li>\n<li>The Rust code is much safer than the equivalent C++ code because it ensures buffers are the correct length and stuff like that.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can find the <a href=\"https://github.com/Rust-GPU/Rust-CUDA/blob/master/examples/cuda/gpu/path_tracer_gpu/src/optix.rs\">GPU Code here</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/Rust-GPU/Rust-CUDA/blob/master/examples/cuda/cpu/path_tracer/src/optix/mod.rs\">CPU Code here</a>.
