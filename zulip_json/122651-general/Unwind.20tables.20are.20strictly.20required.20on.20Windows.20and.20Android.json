Is there a reason that they are <em>strictly</em> required? (They may also even not required to be generated by default when <code>panic = \"abort\"</code>, as now <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/69984\"><code>-C force-unwind-tables</code></a> exists, maybe <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/49867#issuecomment-380485548\">using that for custom unwind tables usages</a> is preferable.)</p>",
