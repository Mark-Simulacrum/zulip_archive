        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116009\">@nikomatsakis</span>, can i request the permission to repost the Into Rust series video to a video site in China? You know many people can't access youtube easily, and a lot of them can't understand english well. So i'm thinking about reposting there (maybe with translated subtitles if i have time to add them) for their easier reach. What do you think?</p>",
