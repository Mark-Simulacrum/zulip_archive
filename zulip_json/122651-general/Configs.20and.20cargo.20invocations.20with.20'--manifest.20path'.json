While the project builds fine as expected when cargo is invoked from within, I find that invoking a build from 'outside' the project directory using the '--manifest-path' directive ignores the customisations in the <code>.cargo/config</code>. FWIW the customisations are a <code>[build]</code> section to define the intended target to build for as well as target specific <code>rustflags</code>.  I thought I'd ask if this is expected behaviour before digging further. Any pointers appreciated! Thanks.</p>",
