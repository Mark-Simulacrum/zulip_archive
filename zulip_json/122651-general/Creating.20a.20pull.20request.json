I've got some changes I've made that have been working towards completing this, however, there is still a lot of work to go. I'd like to keep working on this, but it could take me a while, would this be a decent case where I could create a pull request, get the work I've already done looked at (and hopefully merged) and continue working on the rest of issue, or would the team prefer that I either, step away from the issue and let someone with the time to look at it take over, or I continue working on it when I can?</p>",
