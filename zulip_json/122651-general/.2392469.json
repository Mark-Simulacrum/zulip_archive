Specifically, the kinds of things that can make people feel slightly less welcome when encountered. In the course of reviewing some of the network code, I came across <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/struct.Ipv4Addr.html#impl-From%3Cu32%3E\">these doctest examples</a> (and the one above it), and started to prepare a PR to fix that. Then the thought crossed my mind that contributors to Rust might not know that this is an issue, and it'd be easy for tidy to catch these in the future, which would reduce the chances that a reviewer or moderator would have to explain it to someone submitting a PR in the future. (Such explanations typically involve some degree of \"is today the day someone will pile on to my random GitHub comment, do I want to risk it\", and I wanted to save others that in the future.)</p>",
