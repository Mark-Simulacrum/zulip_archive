I've unset <code>RUSTC_WRAPPER</code>, I'm not using <code>RUSTFLAGS</code>, and I'm not using a <code>config.toml</code>. I've been chatting with <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"119009\">@eddyb</span> in #compiler on Discord. I had it working, then in running some experiments with Eddy, now I can't get it compiling any more. Here's what I'm seeing running <code>./x.py build -i --verbose</code>: <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/dwijnand/2335a671d417a1e4d7a5a14d61cfde9c\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://gist.github.com/dwijnand/2335a671d417a1e4d7a5a14d61cfde9c\">https://gist.github.com/dwijnand/2335a671d417a1e4d7a5a14d61cfde9c</a>.
