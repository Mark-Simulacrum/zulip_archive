Right now it always fails with <code>E0463</code> (<code>can't find crate for foo</code>), however I am specifying <code>--extern foo=target/debug/libfoo.rlib</code> which points to a real file, so there must be some other reason why it can't find or use the crate that it's not mentioning, and with the current error I don't know how to address the problem.</p>",
