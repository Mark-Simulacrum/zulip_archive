For an initial implementation, those methods can just panic, but before this is stabilized there should be some trait bound or similar on them that prevents their use statically. The exact mechanism is more the domain of the custom DST RFC, RFC 1524, and so figuring that mechanism out will be delegated to it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But it appears that's not yet implemented.</p>",
