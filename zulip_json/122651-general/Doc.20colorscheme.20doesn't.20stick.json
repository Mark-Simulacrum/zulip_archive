I use local <code>rustup doc</code> for documentation and it seems the color scheme used is specific to the page it was changed on? The settings are set to <code>ayu</code> globally, but it doesn't seem to do anything. The per-page paintbrush changes the color but it seems like only for that page. What have I been missing for so long?</p>",
