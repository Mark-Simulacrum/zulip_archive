So that didn't work.<br>\nSuppose I was able to tell <code>cargo</code> to link my <code>rlib</code> file, how am I supposed to use it in my application/library? Should I <code>extern crate my_lib;</code> or <code>extern \"C\" { fn my_func() }</code>?<br>\nThank you for your help and for your time. If this doesn't belong here let me know.</p>",
