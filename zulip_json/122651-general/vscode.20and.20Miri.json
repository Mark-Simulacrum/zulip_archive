        "content": "<p>I am trying to get vscode to work properly with Miri. The tricky part is that Miri consists of two (independent) crates, but is not a workspace because that wouldn't work with it also being part of the rustc workspace. So (and also for other reasons) I have a <code>./miri</code> script somewhat similar to <code>./x.py</code>. I configured vscode to use that script:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>    &quot;rust-analyzer.checkOnSave.overrideCommand&quot;: [\n        &quot;./miri&quot;,\n        &quot;check&quot;,\n        &quot;--message-format=json&quot;,\n    ],\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>when I run this on the command-line, it works fine -- at least there is lots of JSON and some of it looks like the error message I am expecting. But in vscode, it doesn't show error for <code>cargo-miri</code> (the crate that is in a subfolder). It does show errors for the \"root\" crate -- almost as if it would ignore my command?<br>\nI am not sure how to debug this. I found a thing called \"extension debug log folder\" and in there I found this</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>[ERROR rust_analyzer::main_loop] File with cargo diagnostic not found in VFS: file not found: /home/r/src/rust/miri/bin.rs\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>but I am not sure if that has any significance. The error JSON does not refer to that file; there's a <code>cargo-miri</code> subfolder that is missing:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>{&quot;reason&quot;:&quot;compiler-message&quot;,&quot;package_id&quot;:&quot;cargo-miri 0.1.0 (path+file:///home/r/src/rust/miri/cargo-miri)&quot;,&quot;target&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:[&quot;bin&quot;],&quot;crate_types&quot;:[&quot;bin&quot;],&quot;name&quot;:&quot;cargo-miri&quot;,&quot;src_path&quot;:&quot;/home/r/src/rust/miri/cargo-miri/bin.rs&quot;,&quot;edition&quot;:&quot;2018&quot;,&quot;doctest&quot;:false,&quot;test&quot;:false},&quot;message&quot;:{&quot;rendered&quot;:&quot;For more information about an error, try `rustc --explain E0069`.\\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[],&quot;code&quot;:null,&quot;level&quot;:&quot;failure-note&quot;,&quot;message&quot;:&quot;For more information about an error, try `rustc --explain E0069`.&quot;,&quot;spans&quot;:[]}}\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Any idea why vscode does not show inline errors for cargo-miri?<br>\nCc <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"133169\">@matklad</span></p>",
