Yes, currently <code>min_const_generics</code> is palliating the initial limited nature of arrays in the type system (compared to other languages), but remember that these initial limitations originate from featuring all the following three things, which, AFAIK, no other language has done:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the super explicit semantics of Rust types (no implicit boxing, <em>etc.</em>);</li>\n<li>compile-time (<em>a.k.a.,</em> \"zero-cost\") polymorphism / meta-programming tool;</li>\n<li>the fact that the main approach for this meta-programming tool, type generics, is <em>eagerly-checked</em> (type generics ≠ macros or C++ templates).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You will notice that if we forego that third requirement, then Rust was already able to use arrays in a \"polymorphic fashion\" thanks to macros (<a href=\"https://docs.rs/uninit/0.4.0/uninit/macro.uninit_array.html\">example</a>).</p>\n<p>So baking the array length within an eagerly-checked generic type system has been a very pioneer thing to do, which definitely has its advantages, but has also had the drawback of not playing well with generics at the time. Now, with <code>min_const_generics</code>, that has been \"fixed\".</p>\n<p>In other words, there is no shame in admitting that at least 95% of what <code>min_const_generics</code> enable is genericity over the fixed-size of an array <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span> </p>\n<hr>\n<p>The next steps will definitely be a polished design of <code>const_evaluatable_checked</code> to allow for inductive things over arrays, and also supporting const <code>&amp;str</code> generics, since that will finally enable nicely expressing within the type system that certain types have certain fields, which allow very nice anonymous struct design, <em>etc.</em> (note that most of this stuff can already be done using <em>ad-hoc</em> types and helper traits with associated <code>const</code>ants, but it was cumbersome, and the error messages were not necessarily very readable).</p>\n<p>Being generic over custom enums will also be nice, although that one is easy to <a href=\"https://github.com/napi-rs/napi-rs/blob/main/napi/src/threadsafe_function.rs#L39-L99\">polyfill using classic generics and a sealed trait</a>, for the most part (the only thing lacking being the trait solver observing that an impl over all variants is an exhaustive impl over that <em>kind</em>, which the current polyfill cannot do, but AFAIK, the current implementation of <code>const_generics</code> doesn't achieve that yet either).</p>",
