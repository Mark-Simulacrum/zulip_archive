        "content": "<p>Hello, I am relatively new to rust. I have been having problems when compiling some code that uses libraries. For example, the rand library has a few examples <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-random/rand\">https://github.com/rust-random/rand</a> like <a href=\"http://monte-carlo.rs\">monte-carlo.rs</a>. Whenever I try to compile, in the following way: rustc <a href=\"http://monte-carlo.rs\">monte-carlo.rs</a>  ; I get an error that tells me to consider adding a <code>main</code> function to <code>monte-carlo.rs</code>. Well, I have the main function in the file so that must not be the problem. Can someone please help me? The same is happening for other libraries. However, I only wanted to run the example in <a href=\"https://github.com/awslabs/shuttle\">https://github.com/awslabs/shuttle</a> . Please someone help me!!!</p>",
