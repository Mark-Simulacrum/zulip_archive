If that the case, you (the kernel) and distro will need to be perfectly align. This is asking for a lot. For example archlinux, always update the rust compiler toolchain the next day(s) after the stable release but in you're case they will need to keep the version of some time because the kernel is using it and the rust and kernel release are not synchronize, but the worse part isn't even the fact that they will need to keep an old stable version (how also probably requires an old llvm, ...) but the fact that the kernel is hacking it making it more \"stable\" than what it really is.</p>",
