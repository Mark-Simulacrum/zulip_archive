An approach to parse 8 digits at a time using only 3 multiplications is described in length <a href=\"https://johnnylee-sde.github.io/Fast-numeric-string-to-int/\">here</a>. This leads to significant performance improvements, and is implemented for both big and little-endian systems.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Has it been considered to apply that to normal string to integer parsing in core as well? It appears that currently the core library does the slower thing of parsing one digit at a time: <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/core/num/mod.rs.html#877\">https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/core/num/mod.rs.html#877</a></p>",
