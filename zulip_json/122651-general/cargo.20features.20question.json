In practice, yes if you ever do <code>cargo build -p</code>, <code>cargo build --manifest-dir</code>, etc. Which is hard to avoid, if you want to test enablement of various features or have a big enough workspace that running all tests for every change is slow.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/build/workspace-hack/Cargo.toml\">https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/build/workspace-hack/Cargo.toml</a> for a common \"solution\" (annoying workaround) to this problem.</p>",
