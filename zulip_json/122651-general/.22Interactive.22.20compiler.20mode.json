I'm very opposed to the general JavaScript-y principle of \"keep running whenever possible\" in code that's actually deployed to users, but I think there's potential benefit for a \"prototype\" compiler mode (in any language, not just Rust) that does its best to run your code despite its issues. This is somewhat like the difference \"release\" and \"debug\" compile modes, except I'd want it to be maximally permissive. Ideally, it would actually be somewhat interactive: if you could fix code errors while the prototype is running (somewhat like the live-debugging mode of some IDEs), that could be an excellent way to understand the meaning of certain errors before trying to correct them.</p>\n<p>I think especially with lifetime errors, this approach could be helpful for understanding what's alive when.</p>\n<p>I think the cargo check concept of &lt;fast but strong checking, no compile&gt; is a really good idea for iteration, but it's probably most beneficial to people who have a somewhat \"abstract\" approach to programming, generally thinking of software in terms of the source code semantics rather than in terms of runtime behavior.</p>\n<p>One danger of adding a \"minimal checking\" mode to Rust is obviously that it could encourage people to release software compiled in that mode, which would be... very very bad for obvious reasons. I think that if Rust had something like what I'm describing, it absolutely should not have a way to turn off the \"interactive\" aspect.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"232545\">Joshua Nelson</span> <a href=\"#narrow/stream/217588-project-leads.20(public)/topic/Rust.20Survey.202020/near/207735882\">said</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>fix code errors while the prototype is running</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>that sounds really amazing <span aria-label=\"smiley\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f603\" role=\"img\" title=\"smiley\">:smiley:</span> I've heard rumors of a REPL based on MIRI, maybe that could fit the 'keep running' interactive model?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"120076\">BatmanAoD (Kyle Strand)</span> <a href=\"#narrow/stream/217588-project-leads.20(public)/topic/Rust.20Survey.202020/near/207735976\">said</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"232545\">Joshua Nelson</span> Yeah, this is an idea I've had kicking around in my head for a long time, but unfortunately I haven't really even fleshed it out, let alone try to build such a thing.</p>\n<p>I do wonder how close MIRI is to that model already, though.</p>\n</blockquote>",
