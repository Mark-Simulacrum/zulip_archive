Whatever value you choose for <code>/FIXED</code> there may be a UEFI implementation for which it won't work. You should probably have a bootloader or the binary itself map the kernel in the higher half of the address space after exiting boot services. Before exiting boot services the page tables are managed by the uefi firmware.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think that's what I'm going to do. I made a new binary that I embed in my efi executable</p>",

(The Linux kernel has a lot of workarounds there.)</p>",
