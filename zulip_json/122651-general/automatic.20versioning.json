        "content": "<p>Hi, I maintain a project which becomes larger and larger (15 libs in a workspace). Several other projects (services and so on) depend on these libs. Until now, we rely on git to manage dependencies, which is quite painful, since modifying a lib requires a modification in all dependent projects to change commit hash. <br>\nInstead of that, we are trying to switch to a private crate registry (we will probably move to <a href=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a> eventually). I would like to manage versioning automatically, so each push on master branch would set packages build number (CARGO_VERSION_PATCH) and publish (crate and documentation) to our crate registry. <br>\nMAJOR and MINOR version would require manual changes (since it is breaking changes or functionality addition), but dependent packages would just specify version = \"MAJOR.MINOR.*\". <br>\nIs there any cargo-compatible-state-of-the-art way to do that, or should I create my own scripts based on environment variables, env substitution in cargo.toml files and so on ? <br>\nThanks for you help</p>",
