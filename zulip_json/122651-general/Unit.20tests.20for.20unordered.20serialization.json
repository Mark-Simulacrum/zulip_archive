I have a function that produces serializable struct, and I want to make sure, given a certain input, that the struct is serialized correctly. However, when checking the output of the serialization (using <code>serde_json</code>) I'm running into flakiness because a part of the struct contains a data structure that's unordered (a <code>HashMap&lt;&amp;'static str, serde_json::Value&gt;</code>), therefore the serialization output can be slightly different, depending on where exactly certain values sit in the tree .. I'm struggling to come up with an idiomatic way of testing this, safe for simple \"grepping\" the string for content .. any pointers?</p>",
