This also means that if it's unspecified you can't do any reasoning about it which means for the rust programmer it's like UB. BUT for the rust compiler programmer it's not the same as they can't take advantage of it. Or at least that is how I think it should be.</p>\n<p>Furthermore the way I see it currently rust has a lot of partial/vague specified behavior around e.g. it's memory model. I.e. while not fully/properly specified we know that certain properties will be specified as not being UB and as working in roughly some already known ways. If we would treat unspecified behavior as UB many rust programs using unsafe code would turn out to be full of UB, even through they are not.</p>\n<p>While assuming that we will have a complete spec is nice it's also unrealistic as new hardware and instructions are added all the time so we will frequently find new specification gaps or unearth older previous overlooked ones.
