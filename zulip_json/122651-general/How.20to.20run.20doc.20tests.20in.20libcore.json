For testing purposes, I've replaced one of them with <code>assert!(false);</code> and since I haven't gotten any failures I'm assuming they're not running. What I've tried to far is to run <code>./x.py test --stage 1 src/libcore</code> and the same with the addition of the <code>--doc</code> flag. In the <code>--doc</code> case, the last line of output indicated that the build succesfully completed in some amount of time; without the <code>--doc</code>, some tests were also run but none of them failed, so I'm assuming thats not the doctests. What is the right procedure here?</p>",
