I'm noticing that basically all parts of the AST have a span, but I really want a way to pretty print \"here is the chunk of the original source - as a string - that corresponds with this span\", rather than the \"low and high byte positions\".</p>\n<p>Is there a good way to do this conversion?</p>\n<p>Context: <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/struct.SpanData.html\">https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/struct.SpanData.html</a></p>",
