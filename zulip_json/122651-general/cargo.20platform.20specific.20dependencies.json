In macos it uses VCPKG to provide that dependency. In linux it just uses the sdl2 lib. I've used platform specific dependencies:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>[target.&#39;cfg(target_os = &quot;linux&quot;)&#39;.dependencies.sdl2]\nversion = &quot;0.34.3&quot;\ndefault-features = false\nfeatures = [&quot;ttf&quot;, &quot;mixer&quot;]\n\n[target.&#39;cfg(target_os = &quot;macos&quot;)&#39;.dependencies.sdl2]\nversion = &quot;0.34.3&quot;\ndefault-features = false\nfeatures = [&quot;ttf&quot;, &quot;mixer&quot;, &quot;static-link&quot;, &quot;use-vcpkg&quot;]\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>but in linux the build fails with \"No vcpkg installation found. Set the VCPKG_ROOT environment variable or run \\'vcpkg integrate install\\'\"</p>\n<p>The linux build shouldn't be looking for VCPKG at all, that should be mac specific. If I remove the macos specific dependencies it builds and runs and plays fine in Linux. I wonder if this is a cargo issue or something weird they've done with the VCPKG crate.</p>",
