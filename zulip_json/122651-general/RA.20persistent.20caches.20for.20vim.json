In that issue <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues/4712#issuecomment-708522326\">matklad mentioned</a> that RA won't implement persistent cache.<br>\nAs a user of vim, I was really interested in knowing if there is any existing way or hack to get this feature for vim? If not, should I try to make it myself? I am a total noob with RA's internals at least, so wasn't sure about the difficulty level.</p>",
