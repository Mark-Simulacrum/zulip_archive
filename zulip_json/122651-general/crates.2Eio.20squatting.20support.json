I already do this in my Cargo.toml files, using <code>sha1 = { package = \"sha-1\" }</code>. This already signals my disintent to use the top-level <code>sha1</code> crate, and that anywhere I use <code>sha1</code> in my code, I only want to use the genuine crate as published by RustCrypto.</p>\n<p>That's the use case I'm trying to facilitate. :-)</p>",
