The <code>staged_api</code> attribute really doesn't do much on its own, so there's not much to say about it.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions not answered in that chapter, feel free to ask.  I may be able to answer them, or if not try to figure it out. Or you can open a PR on the rustc-dev-guide if  there's something you'd like to add.</p>",
