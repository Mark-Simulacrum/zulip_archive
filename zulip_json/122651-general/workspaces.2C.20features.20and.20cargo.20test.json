I have a workspace, and the main crate, coi, has multiple features, one of which causes a feature of a dependency to turn on and off (async feature of coi-derive). I have several crates in my workspace that are used solely to test that my crate's functionality works with all combination of features. Going into each directory and running <code>cargo test</code> works as expected. <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/Nashenas88/50d7e99e78805ad1a50c239cf6fb2930\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://gist.github.com/Nashenas88/50d7e99e78805ad1a50c239cf6fb2930\">https://gist.github.com/Nashenas88/50d7e99e78805ad1a50c239cf6fb2930</a> Running <code>cargo test</code> at the root of the workspace does not: <a href=\"https://travis-ci.org/Nashenas88/coi/jobs/632791155\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://travis-ci.org/Nashenas88/coi/jobs/632791155\">https://travis-ci.org/Nashenas88/coi/jobs/632791155</a> .
