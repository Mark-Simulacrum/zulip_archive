Just like it can be worth <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/58530\">outlining <code>impl AsRef</code></a>, it can be worth outlining const generic things to use slice versions internally.  And many things, like the <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/62435/files#diff-0986668cbf34a4055af5918b7a77c510R369\"><code>Hash</code> impls</a> already do that.
