I was asked to ping <code>@rust-lang/rustdoc</code> by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"232545\">@Joshua Nelson</span> but I stopped doing that because I thought the ping is useless, I don't know who are the members on the team, <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/rust-lang/teams/rustdoc\">https://github.com/orgs/rust-lang/teams/rustdoc</a> is 404 for me. I wonder if I need to join a team to see this?</p>\n<p>Also, is there a team for random stuff where we could just work on random stuff but I think contributor can do this already without joining a team? I believe people like <code>Lonami</code>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"209117\">@lzutao</span> (maybe not since he mainly do performance related stuff) and me could be categorized here. I personally would like to help out more on reviewing pull requests but I want to contribute to libs and some compiler suggestion stuff. Should we just stay as normal contributors?</p>",

You can change the compiler without being on compiler; you can change the library without being on libs or libs-impl; you can put review comments on PRs without having sign-off permissions; you can attend the language design meetings without being on lang; etc.</p>",
