In this case, the import would <em>not</em> be found by <code>rustc</code>.</p>\n<p>As for why it not re-build <code>rome_rowan</code>, I'm not sure. Perhaps it was some combination of  using the <code>-p</code> and <code>--no-deps</code> flags for <code>cargo doc</code>, which did something to limit any re-building to only source code changes within <code>rome_js_syntax</code> (and thus ignoring any source code changes in <code>rome_js_syntax</code>). Just a guess though. I'm not sure.</p>\n<p>Deleting <code>target/</code> had to have wiped some stale bit of data that was stopping the rebuild of <code>rome_js_syntax</code>.</p>\n<p>Happy I'm unblocked though. :)</p>",
