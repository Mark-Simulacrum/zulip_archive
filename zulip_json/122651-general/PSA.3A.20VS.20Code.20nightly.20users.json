File nesting is experimental and lets you collapse multiple files into a single logical item automatically. Personally I have expansion disabled by default, as most of the time you don't need to see everything.</p>\n<p>To enable:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go to your settings (ctrl + comma)</li>\n<li>Search for file nesting</li>\n<li>Check the box for \"File Nesting: Enabled\"</li>\n<li>Optionally uncheck the box for \"File Nesting: Expand\"</li>\n<li>Add the following rule to \"File Nesting: Patterns\":<ul>\n<li>Item: <code>*.rs</code></li>\n<li>Value: <code>$(capture).stderr, $(capture).fixed, $(capture).stdout, $(capture).*.stderr</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This will collapse all stdout, stderr, and fixed files under the code for the UI test. It can be expanded like any directory.</p>\n<p>Hopefully this is useful to somebody! I've had it enabled for a few days and certainly find it beneficial.</p>",
