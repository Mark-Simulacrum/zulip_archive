I created it for Cargo's git2 dependency on libssh2 and I don't have much time to do much other than that. I can try to merge bug fixes when I get a chance but if all you're gonna do is continue to be annoyed at me for having other things to do in life then I'm not really gonna set aside time to try to get this merged. I'll talk with other cargo folks to see if they'd like to be interested in helping to maintain this library.</p>",
