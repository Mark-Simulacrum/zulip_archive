I haven't yet been able to reduce it down to a minimally reproducible example (it's in a closed-source crate) but I'm looking for some help on where to start looking. Compiling with <code>cargo rustc --lib -- -Z time-passes</code>, the last time pass output before it hangs is:<br>\n<code>time:   0.076; rss:  335MB -&gt;  357MB (  +22MB) item_types_checking</code><br>\nI have been able to reproduce on the latest nightly and stable. It appears to hang locally, but on CI (Github Actions) it is terminated with <code>(signal: 9, SIGKILL: kill)</code> after around 5 minutes.</p>",
