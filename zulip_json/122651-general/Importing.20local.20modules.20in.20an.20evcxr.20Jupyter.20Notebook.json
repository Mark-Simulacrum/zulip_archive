Let's say I have a struct in a <code>src/models/goodreads.rs</code> file:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};\n\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]\npub struct Book {\n    pub title: String,\n    pub author: String,\n    pub rating: f32,\n    pub num_ratings: u64,\n    pub year_published: u32,\n}\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>How do I <code>use</code> that struct in a Jupyter Notebook? Obviously, if I were in another file, I would just do:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>use crate::models::goodreads::Book;\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>But that doesn't work in a Jupyter Notebook.</p>\n<p>I really appreciate the help! I've been hitting my head against this for a while.</p>",

Thanks for the help.</p>\n<p>I hadn't looked at that specific series but I've been following a lot of interactive notebooks. Those all generate their code in the notebook, which makes sense if you're guiding someone. I'll check that one out though and see if it doesn't help. Cheers.</p>",
