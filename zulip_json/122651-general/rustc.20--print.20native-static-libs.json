Historically it was always displayed during compilation, and it was changed to only display the link list with the <code>--print</code> flag. I think it is geared towards \"you just built a staticlib, here's how you can link it\". And some people didn't like that it <em>always</em> printed it, so it was changed to a flag. Also, presumably, the answer isn't known until translation phase.  It's definitely an odd flag, as it's the only one that doesn't stop compilation.</p>",
