I was wondering if I could pick Rust as my source language and write a very basic compiler for it, would that be feasible for me to write by myself? </p>\n<p>If not, I would probably write a compiler IN rust instead. I just wanted some thoughts/tips/advice from the veteran coders on here :)</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>",
