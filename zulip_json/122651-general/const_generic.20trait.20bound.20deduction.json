Basically I am trying to figure out if I should expect the snippet to compile once the const_generics feature is completed. I would expect that the trait bound would be auto-deduced since it can be fully evaluated but from the paragraph on the RFC I think it's meant to work this way. Also using parameter deduction for the single statement on the final create function leads to ICE.</p>",
