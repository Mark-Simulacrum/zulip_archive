They may be invoked in a type expression, item position (except as a statement), including items in extern blocks, inherent and trait implementations, and trait definitions. <strong>They cannot be used in a statement, expression, or pattern.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yet it seems that I can do <code>println!(\"{}\", my_proc_macro!())</code> on stable Rust. It seems that <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/68717\">#68717</a> introduced this. Is the reference out of date or am I missing something?</p>",
