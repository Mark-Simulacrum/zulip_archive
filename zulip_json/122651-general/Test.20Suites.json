Once the infrastructure is set up, I can run different tests, clean-up data if required in between such tests.<br>\nThis looks like a bit like \"test suite\": </p>\n<ul>\n<li>before_all =&gt; set-up an infrastructure, </li>\n<li>\n<p>after_all: clean and shut_down<br>\nIn between, tests can run sequentially: </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>insert some data, check it's received and published to another system</p>\n</li>\n<li>clean-up the DB</li>\n<li>perform another tests<br>\nThis obviously break test parallelism, etc. <br>\nFor now the only workaround I found is putting everything in a single test function. It works, but is quite obnoxious.<br>\nWould anyone have any recommendation, pointer, or just some part of the docs I missed to tackle this properly?<br>\nThanks a lot.</li>\n</ul>",
