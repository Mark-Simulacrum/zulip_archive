But if you're using it as an example of how to speak LSP but writing everything independently, then you might not <em>need</em> do do anything -- ideas aren't subject to copyright.  Of course, a note of thanks in the documentation is always a nice thing to do.</p>\n<p>(Obligatory IANAL, etc.)</p>",

There are times when I copied code because I couldn't think of a better way to do something. That said, I often simplify it after seeing what I actually want / need. I will put a link to rust-analyzer in the README. The code is open-source, I am just not sure about the correct license procedure.</p>",
