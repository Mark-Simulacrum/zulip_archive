I am using the <code>nix</code> crate, and I <em>believe</em> I am utilizing it correctly, but I am getting an EFAULT (Invalid Address). Not that it is super relevant, but I am experiencing the same behavior within Python. I am printing out the integer generated by <code>_IOWR</code>, and it matches that same values (decimal and hex) generated by the C code, so I am at a bit of a loss. I have all of the structures as <code>[repr(C, packed)]</code> to make sure they match what C is doing, and the size looks the same as the C code, as well. Does anyone have experience with this crate, or working with ioctls, who might have some ideas of what I might be missing here? </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2021&amp;gist=e6dc85feb0e91bab9780e047d73d9376\">Current Code Example</a></p>",
