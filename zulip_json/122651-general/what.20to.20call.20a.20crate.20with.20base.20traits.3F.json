To my knowledge, this requires splitting up my code into three pieces:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The \"base\" traits and their implementations</li>\n<li>The proc-macro crate (depends on 1)</li>\n<li>The user entrypoint crate (depends on 1, will depend on 2 via feature flag)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Normally I have a naming scheme of <code>foo</code> and <code>foo-derive</code> for 3 and 2, respectively. I don't have experience with naming 1, and I can't think of any similar crates that I could borrow from. My current thoughts are leaning towards <code>foo-traits</code>.</p>\n<p>Are there any existing crates that have this pattern? Does <code>-traits</code> sound like a good idea?</p>",
