        "content": "<p>I just ran into something confusing with <code>download-rustc</code>: normal <code>x.py build</code> will build rustdoc and put it in <strong>stage1</strong>. However, <code>x.py build</code> with <code>download-rustc</code> enabled will put it in <strong>stage2</strong>. This means that <code>rustdoc +stage1 ...</code> won't run my local, modified version of rustdoc if <code>download-rustc</code> is set. Specifically, <code>rustdoc +stage1 ...</code> seems to run <em>nightly</em> rustdoc (or something static).</p>\n<p>I'm guessing this is because rustdoc built with <code>download-rustc</code> is being built with stage2 rustc, thus it is stage2 rustdoc, whereas rustdoc built locally <em>without</em> <code>download-rustc</code> is usually built with stage1 rustc, thus it is stage1 rustdoc. However, this behavior was very confusing to me and it took me a bunch of experimenting to figure out why my changes weren't showing up in the rustdoc output.</p>\n<p>I imagine it could be even more confusing for new contributors since we recommend using stage1 builds, but then when they use <code>download-rustc</code> they have to remember that it's actually a <em>stage2</em> build and adjust their commands accordingly. Plus, it's frustrating even if you know what's going on to switch between stage1 and stage2 depending on whether you're working on rustc or rustdoc (or a different tool).</p>\n<p>Is there any way to solve this problem? I imagine there are multiple possible solutions, some better than others.</p>\n<p>cc <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"232545\">@Joshua Nelson</span></p>",
