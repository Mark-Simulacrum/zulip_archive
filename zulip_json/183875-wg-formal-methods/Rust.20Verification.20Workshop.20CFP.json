Key items:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We solicit proposals for contributed talks and tool demos. Proposals should be at most 2 pages, in either plain text or PDF format, and should specify how long a talk/demo the speaker wishes to give. By default, contributed talks will be 30 minutes long, but proposals for shorter or longer talks will also be considered.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We are interested in talks/demos on all topics related to the verification of Rust programs (including, for instance, program specification, deductive verification, model checking, symbolic execution, runtime monitoring, the semantics and formalization of Rust, and tool support). Talks about work in progress as well as proposals for challenge problems in Rust are particularly encouraged.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Important Dates:</strong><br>\n15 January, 2021: Abstract Submission Deadline<br>\n25 January, 2021: Notification of Acceptance<br>\n28 March, 2021: Workshop</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>More details are <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/rustverify2021\">on the workshop web site</a></p>",
