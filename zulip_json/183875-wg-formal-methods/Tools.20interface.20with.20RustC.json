Discussions relevant to this project will be hosted here: <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"320896\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/320896-project-stable-mir\">#project-stable-mir</a>.</p>\n<p>I created a topic to start gathering requirements from different tools: <a href=\"#narrow/stream/320896-project-stable-mir/topic/Current.20use.20cases.20of.20rustc.20MIR\">https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/320896-project-stable-mir/topic/Current.20use.20cases.20of.20rustc.20MIR</a></p>\n<p>It would be amazing if you can add any relevant information there about the tools you've been working on.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
