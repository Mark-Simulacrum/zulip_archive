I've attached a poll at the end of this announcement to vote on dates for the meeting.</p>\n<p>The objective is for these meetings to be a monthly forum for people interested in parties the design and implementation of verification (and static-analysis) tools for Rust. To encourage participation, I'm proposing that each meeting includes a presentation on a relevant topic followed by an open discussion. If community members have questions they would like discussed they can submit them ahead of time or during the meeting. Additionally, we can organize 'office hours' with members of the Rust compiler teams. </p>\n<p>The meetings will be online on Zoom and will be recorded so that those who can't participate can still watch. Additionally, I will attempt to take minutes so that we can have a textual summary of the discussions. </p>\n<p>Of course, these meetings are meant to be a <em>community</em> project, so if you have suggestions or comments, please reply!</p>\n<p>The meeting time poll: <a href=\"https://framadate.org/B3zpngEqpQ6Ctflp\">https://framadate.org/B3zpngEqpQ6Ctflp</a></p>\n<h1>Specification Challenge</h1>\n<p>I also believe that these meetings are a great opportunity to gather community feedback on shared issues such as specification languages. So I'd like to propose a little challenge for September.</p>\n<p>The idea is that everyone submits a few short (20 line max) programs which they would like to see specified, and then we each specify the programs of others. (cc @Alastair Reed).<br>\nWe would then discuss these specified programs during one of the upcoming meetings. <br>\nI will post reminders about this and gather the submitted programs. </p>\n<h1>Upcoming Schedule</h1>\n<p>I have a tentative schedule for the first two meetings, of course this is <em>flexible</em>, if we feel this doesn't serve our needs or interests it will be adjusted as needed. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>September</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Topic: Introductions</li>\n<li>Presentation: To Be Announced</li>\n<li>Proposed Discussion Topics:<ul>\n<li>Structure &amp; Format of these meetings</li>\n<li>Scope of the WG</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Office Hours?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>October</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Topic: Specifications</li>\n<li>Presentation: </li>\n<li>Proposed Topics:<ul>\n<li>Discussion of submitted and specified programs</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",
