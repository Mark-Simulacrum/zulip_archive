I wanted to share with you what I've been doing for a couple of months from November to January : <a href=\"https://blog.merigoux.fr/en/2019/04/16/verifying-rust.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://blog.merigoux.fr/en/2019/04/16/verifying-rust.html\">https://blog.merigoux.fr/en/2019/04/16/verifying-rust.html</a>. This blog post is intended for people who don't really know what verification is, so you can jump directly into the two case studies : <a href=\"https://blog.merigoux.fr/en/2019/04/16/textinput.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://blog.merigoux.fr/en/2019/04/16/textinput.html\">https://blog.merigoux.fr/en/2019/04/16/textinput.html</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.merigoux.fr/en/2019/04/16/bloom-filter.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://blog.merigoux.fr/en/2019/04/16/bloom-filter.html\">https://blog.merigoux.fr/en/2019/04/16/bloom-filter.html</a>. Basically I've translated manually bits of Rust code into F* and proven properties about them; you can see the result <a href=\"https://github.com/denismerigoux/rox-star\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/denismerigoux/rox-star\">https://github.com/denismerigoux/rox-star</a>.</p>",

I just wanted to clarify what seems to be a misconception about Viper: Viper is an infrastructure for deductive verification of concurrent programs. As such it can be used to prove full functional correctness, for example, to verify that if a binary search function returned <code>None</code>, then the searched element is not in the array. Viper has two back-end verifiers; one is based on symbolic execution and another is based on verification condition generation. If you have any questions, I would be happy to answer them.</p>",

        "content": "<p>This is so, so exciting!  I have a number of types of specs I would love to figure out how to write + prove about software in rust.  For example, it would be amazing to prove things about flow control in a proxy (like <a href=\"https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/source/docs/flow_control.md\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/source/docs/flow_control.md\">https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/source/docs/flow_control.md</a> ), and formally show that each connection or request had a configurable but fixed amount of memory it could consume.  It would be fascinating to figure out how specs for fairly low-level stuff like this combine, and how modular they can be: how much would a flow-control spec have to change when you add another spec about correctness of routing (or about how every incoming request must get a JSON response back).</p>\n<p>Do you have strong feelings about whether you will be able to write _all_ specs in rust, or if there are things you would necessarily need to fall back to F* for?  Writing specs in a functional language like F* seems totally reasonable, and if it can keep the specs themselves shorter that also seems like a win.</p>",

A possible approach for verifying this would be:<br>\n1.

Propagate up the stack the preconditions that ensure that the invariant is maintained (this would probably include making sure that watermarks are not leaked and allowing to write only if the most recently seen watermark was low).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It would be fascinating to figure out how specs for fairly low-level stuff like this combine, and how modular they can be: how much would a flow-control spec have to change when you add another spec about correctness of routing</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It depends on how deeply related are the concepts you specify. For example, does the routing depend on the state of watermarks? If not, then specifications could be completely independent.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do you have strong feelings about whether you will be able to write _all_ specs in rust, or if there are things you would necessarily need to fall back to F* for?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For expressing properties such as sortidness of an array, it is necessary to have support for quantifiers, which are not part of Rust. However, since one can use a custom parser for Rust annotations, it is possible to write specifications in “extended Rust”. For example, a sortidness could be written as follows (edited):</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"cp\">#[requires=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;forall |i: usize, j: usize| {i &lt;= j ==&gt; arr[i] &lt;= arr[j]}&quot;</span><span class=\"cp\">]</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"k\">fn</span> <span class=\"nf\">binary_search</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">arr</span>: <span class=\"nb\">Vec</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"kt\">i32</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>-&gt; <span class=\"p\">...</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</pre></div>",
