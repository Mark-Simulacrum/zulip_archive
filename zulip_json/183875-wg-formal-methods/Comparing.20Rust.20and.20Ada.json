Does anyone here know a good comparison of Rust and Ada? It is my understanding that Ada itself has no notion of ownership/borrowing, so where Rust shines when verifying memory management, Ada provides little support. Is that correct? (It is then often pointed out that Ada programs often use way fewer pointers than C++ or Rust programs would, but still, in terms of comparing language capabilities that seems like an important point.) What about concurrency; I read that newer versions of Ada have built-in \"parallel blocks\" but what does the type-checker do to avoid data races?<br>\nAnd then there is Ada/SPARK, but that is backed by a theorem prover, so at this point we'd have to compare with Prusti or so, right? (Of course SPARK is much more mature that what Rust has in this space.)<br>\nI've been curious about this myself for quite some time, and sadly never had the chance of having a long conversation with an Ada expert to get to the bottom of this.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Very nice article btw! I was invited by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"312719\">@Xavier Denis</span> to answer questions on Ada and SPARK. SPARK is indeed a subset of Ada, like MISRA C is a subset of C (I even wrote a comparison about that at <a href=\"https://learn.adacore.com/courses/SPARK_for_the_MISRA_C_Developer/\">https://learn.adacore.com/courses/SPARK_for_the_MISRA_C_Developer/</a>), but the goal with SPARK is to provide guarantees statically about the program, by static analysis and proof. Ada does not provide as many guarantees statically as Rust regarding dynamic memory and concurrency. Regarding pointers, its main focus is on pointers to the stack, which by typing can't become dangling pointers: you can declare local pointer types for pointer variables that _can_ point to a stack variable of the same or a less-nested scope, but can't point to a stack variable of a more-nested scope. You can also have a form of local memory reclamation by declaring a local pointer type with its own \"memory pool\" in which all dynamically allocated pointers of that type are allocated, which is freed when the scope is exited. The typing rules ensure that this does not lead again to dangling pointers. But there are no guarantees for more liberal use of dynamic allocation, in particular the \"free\" function is called Unchecked_Deallocation and opens the door to double-free or use-after-free, and you are not protected against memory leaks when not using a local \"memory pool\".  Similarly, Ada does not provide as many guarantees statically as Rust regarding concurrent access to shared data/resources. The safe way to access shared data/resources is to use \"protected objects\" (with their own lock) but nothing forces you to comply with it. The parallel features in the upcoming version of Ada are not implemented in GNAT/SPARK today and may not be for some time. </p>\n<p>SPARK supports both pointers and concurrency safely by restricting what you can do. For concurrency, that means only accessing shared data that is \"synchronized\" (exact definition here: <a href=\"https://docs.adacore.com/live/wave/spark2014/html/spark2014_rm/tasks-and-synchronization.html\">https://docs.adacore.com/live/wave/spark2014/html/spark2014_rm/tasks-and-synchronization.html</a> so that includes atomic objects and protected objects). For pointers, that means following a simple ownership policy modeled after Rust ownership policy. That allows us to deal with pointers in proof like we do for other data structures, without worrying about possible aliasing. The difficulty comes with mutating a linked data structure while traversing it, and here my colleague Claire Dross initially implemented last year the pledges from Prusti and recently replaced them with the prophecy variables that <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"312719\">@Xavier Denis</span> is using in his PhD work. You can see an example of use of prophecy variables here: <a href=\"https://github.com/yannickmoy/am2sp/blob/db487410991cd5373c56f0f251013b85c2e5aef0/src/list_arith.adb#L34\">https://github.com/yannickmoy/am2sp/blob/db487410991cd5373c56f0f251013b85c2e5aef0/src/list_arith.adb#L34</a> and the equivalent with pledges here: <a href=\"https://github.com/yannickmoy/am2sp/blob/0ecdec063a5f09aa246061154c8a6b560d87b85a/src/list_arith.adb#L35\">https://github.com/yannickmoy/am2sp/blob/0ecdec063a5f09aa246061154c8a6b560d87b85a/src/list_arith.adb#L35</a> The SPARK User's Guide now contains a variety of typical loop invariants with prophecy variables: <a href=\"https://docs.adacore.com/live/wave/spark2014/html/spark2014_ug/en/source/loop.html\">https://docs.adacore.com/live/wave/spark2014/html/spark2014_ug/en/source/loop.html</a> (just look for occurrences of \"At_End\").   </p>\n<p>That being said, we'd like to include more static guarantees in Ada itself in the future (enforced only by compilation, while the current solution for SPARK is based on a mix of ownership checking and proof for things like non-null pointer dereference checks and absence of memory leaks), and of course we're looking at Rust as a main source of inspiration here!</p>",
