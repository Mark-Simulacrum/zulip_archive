That could allow doing things like QuickCheck with contracts/properties as test-time assertions for easy, no dependency checking that might catch some quick and easy bugs, while you could use a full-fledged verifier that might have more dependencies (like Prusti, which depends on Java), or a full fledged fuzzer which might also have substantial dependencies, to get more in-depth analysis.</p>\n<p>I've only just started exploring these tools, so I don't have a strong opinion of which Arbitrary trait has the best interface or what a core common contracts interface would look like, but I'm wondering if anyone has an opinion on which of the contracts crates or Arbitrary traits would be best as a starting point for standardization.</p>",

Some kind of common core contracts system, so that libraries could declare various contract information, which could be used either as runtime assertions, maybe in some cases only in debug mode during testing or maybe sometimes at runtime, but which could also be used, potentially with some extra richer annotations for a given proof system, for formal verification.</p>",
