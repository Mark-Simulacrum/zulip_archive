        "content": "<p>Hi all!</p>\n<p>My employer CancerIQ currently uses Rust for all of our logic related to cancer risk assessment and clinical decision support. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"220273\">@Jane Lusby</span>, your talk really inspired me to rethink the error handling story there, which I hugely appreciate. We're slowly moving from <code>panic!</code> everywhere and a global unwind catcher to <code>anyhow</code> and <code>thiserror</code>-based error types.</p>\n<p>This is really great, obviously a huge improvement over the hacky system we were using before, but we still don't have a very good story around structured logging, which is really important for our other services. Right now, our Rust code is the only code that doesn't give out nicely formatted JSON logs. This is partly because our largest and most important service is using Iron 0.6, which has a rather poor logging and monitoring story, and partly because there's just not great support for structured logging in the logging ecosystem in general.</p>\n<p>These are all problems we can solve, especially in that once Rocket 0.5 lands we will be able to move from Iron to Rocket (management doesn't like the risks involved with using a nightly Rust compiler for a production CDS service), and Rocket will have much more extensible logging. This just leaves us with the issue of how to get structured error data up to the level where it can be logged and returned with sufficient context.</p>\n<p>With <code>anyhow</code> and <code>thiserror</code>, we generally define commonly-used error types with <code>thiserror</code>, such as errors that occur in our family graph logic and are common to many different pieces of logic. We then use the <code>anyhow::Result</code> type as the return type for the vast majority of functions and use <code>.with_context</code> to add context at each level. This leads to really well contextualized errors, and I can see my way towards implementing a semi-structured logging method using <code>anyhow::Error::chain</code>, but what I really want is a way to put in arbitrary key-value pairs along with a message and reconstitute them in a hierarchy at the top level. Obviously this is not a real API, but I'm thinking of something like:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">foobar</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">frobnicate</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">baz</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">with_context</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">||</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">error_vals</span><span class=\"o\">!</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\"the foobar failed to frobnicate the baz\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">foobar_version</span>: <span class=\"nc\">foobar</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">version</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">baz_size</span>: <span class=\"nc\">baz</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">capacity</span><span class=\"p\">())</span><span class=\"o\">?</span><span class=\"p\">;</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Which I could then reconstitute into a JSON object like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"JSON\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">\"message\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"the foobar failed to frobnicate the baz\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">\"foobar_version\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"2.3.2\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">\"baz_size\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">32</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">\"cause\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"nt\">\"message\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"foobar cache was inconsistent\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"nt\">\"cache_size\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">93120</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"err\">//</span> <span class=\"err\">...</span> <span class=\"err\">more</span> <span class=\"err\">stuff</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>As I'm working in a non-embedded, memory-wide use case, I'm happy to allocate to do this; even just having a vector of tuples would be fine. My basic question is, is the direction things are moving likely to result in something that would support this as a possibility? Does this sound like a use case others are describing? If I were to build something like this for CancerIQ, would the error handling group be interested in that work?</p>\n<p>Thanks a ton!</p>",
