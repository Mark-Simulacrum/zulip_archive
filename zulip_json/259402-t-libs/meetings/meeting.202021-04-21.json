However, this time we have zero rfcs, zero nominated items, and zero waiting-on-team items waiting for us (not counting those we already discussed last time). We do however have 27 PRs and some issues waiting for a review/response. So I was thinking to maybe skip the meeting this week and instead spend this time working on reviews etc. Or does anyone have something we should discuss today?</p>",
