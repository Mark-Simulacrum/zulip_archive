I've started the FCP on <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/90896\">#90896</a>. rfc 3192 is still in active discussion. and rfc 3184 was discussed last time. And with that there's only <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/90830\">#90830</a> left, which we can discuss asynchronously on the issue, or next meeting. So let's skip today's API meeting as well, and take that time to instead handle our many open FCP checkboxes: <a href=\"https://rfcbot.rs/\">https://rfcbot.rs/</a></p>",
