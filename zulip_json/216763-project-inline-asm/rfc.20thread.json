Overall, I'm quite positive, but I'd like to make a meta-note: this rfc thread is getting really long! So far it strikes me as mostly some high quality questions and answers. </p>\n<p>I'm wondering though best to manage it. Perhaps things are just fine here, but one idea I've been toying with for longer threads is to close the RFC periodically and collect the questions etc into a FAQ and summary, and then open a new RFC that starts with that summary. The hope would be that people who come to the RFC would be able to quickly pick up the context and avoid repeat questions, and that it would be RFC authors a bit of time to catch up on people's questions and integrate any changes they plan to make.</p>\n<p>That said, it may not be necessary in this case. =)</p>",
