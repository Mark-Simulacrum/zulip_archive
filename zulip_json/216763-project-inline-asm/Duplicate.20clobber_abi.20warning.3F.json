However there are often a lot of aliases for the same ABI, for example <code>C</code> == <code>system</code> on all current targets.  Should there be detection and a warning/lint/error for when redundant clobber_abi are specified?</p>\n<p>cc <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"143274\">@Amanieu</span></p>",
