Has it been asked in the past?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Not in this form. We previously asked about \"What is your experience with other tools you use?\" and then asked for a rating from \"really like\" to \"really dislike\" (with the option of don't use). <br>\nI suppose there are three aspects we may want to capture:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is perceived quality level of the tool?</li>\n<li>How much has the tool's quality changed over the past year?</li>\n<li>How essential is the tool to people?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I believe the first one can also be measured or answered through other means (e.g., bug reports, blog post analysis, etc.). The second can be answered with year over year analysis (which while difficult when changing questions is not impossible). The third is the most subjective and hardest to tell from other sources. It captures the level of relative importance that the tools have and can even easily differentiate between tools that are not popular but still essential to those who use them (e.g., I imagine miri might fall in this category).</p>",
