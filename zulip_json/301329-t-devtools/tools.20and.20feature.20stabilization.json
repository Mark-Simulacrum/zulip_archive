If that were the case we wouldn't have <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/labels/T-async-await\">async-await</a> to this day.</p>\n<p>For the <code>let_else</code> feature we already found and fixed a <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/7912\">two</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/7637\">bugs</a> in Clippy.</p>\n<p>Though for Clippy it is useful if a features lives a bit longer in nightly, so bugs in lints because of new features don't get into stable. A recent example of this is the implicit named arguments feature, which broke our <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/8290\"><code>useless_format</code></a> lint. This bug got into stable, but with 1.58.1 we were lucky and could backport the fix. I think this feature was for a too short of a time in <code>nightly</code>, so that no one was using it, who also hit the Clippy lint. </p>\n<p>So blocking stabilization because of Clippy is not an option. But possibly waiting an addition nightly cycle might be useful in some cases.</p>",
