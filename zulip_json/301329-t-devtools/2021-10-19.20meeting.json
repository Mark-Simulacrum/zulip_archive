The badge requests we receive are overwhelmingly for SVGs but we also provide PNGs and have a separate microservice that handles rasterization.</p>\n<p>We recently rewrote that rasterization microservice from a Node.js with Puppeteer &amp; Chromium implementation to a Rust-based API that utilizes the bindings for Cairo, Gio and GLib and that change has been a massive win for us. It's provided a ~90% savings on hosting costs, and allows us to serve better badges (emoji support, letter spacing, etc.) with lower response times (and that's despite me lazily/clumsily stumbling my way through the implementation!)</p>\n<p>Obviously all of those benefits don't necessarily come _directly_ from Rust, but the migration as a whole is what allowed us to realize those benefits, and those gtk-rs bindings were a crucial piece of being able to make that migration happen, so thank you!</p>",
