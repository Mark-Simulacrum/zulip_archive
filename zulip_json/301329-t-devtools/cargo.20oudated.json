(but it is already much faster than running <code>cargo outdated</code>)</p>\n<p>I insisted on using cargo's internals instead of external libraries to keep this PR-able, but I am not sure what's the process here, I know there's a <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/4309\">cargo oudated issue</a> which have been a bit silent now. So do I keep working on this and then just PR it? What would a Minimum Viable Product of the feature be so that I work towards it? Or is it better for me to develop it out of band and then PR it wholesale later down the line?</p>\n<p>Thanks <span aria-label=\"heart\" class=\"emoji emoji-2764\" role=\"img\" title=\"heart\">:heart:</span></p>",
