I've (and some other members of core) been engaging with rust-analyzer folks (primarily <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"133169\">@matklad</span>) on getting rust-analyzer in position to be officially adopted. We're <em>very</em> close, and I think once that happens, we can have more clear discussions on how to sunset rls</p>",
