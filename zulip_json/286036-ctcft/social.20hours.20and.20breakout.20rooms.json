I think Meetup groups (there are a growing number of Rust specific monthly meetups) and Women Who Code leading mentoring and social gatherings outside a game construct are excellent examples of the options.  Building a game versus starting a Zoom call or discord voice chat would create a delay and effort burden that I think volunteers would rather avoid.
