Is anyone interested in joining a meeting to brainstorm ideas?</p>\n<p>Just some off the cuff ideas we've come up with so far:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Automating <code>cargo bisect-rustc</code> even more, so maintainers or contributors can run it from a github issues bot without having to clone and run the tool themselves</li>\n<li>Triaging issues - some of this needs expertise, but new contributors could help with things like \"is this a cargo or rustdoc bug\" and making it easy to reproduce the bug (e.g. making a github repo or MCVE that reproduces the bug)</li>\n</ul>",
