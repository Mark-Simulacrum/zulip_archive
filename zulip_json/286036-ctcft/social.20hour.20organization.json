Attendees are then randomly assigned to rooms. Depending on the amount of time available, organizers might bring the full group back together and then send them out to rooms again.  The idea is that being randomly assigned they will meet different people.  </p>\n<p>A second model I've participated in assigns either a purpose or an individual to each room and then attendees decide which room to join based upon what  or who is the focus.  For example, a virtual hiring event will have one company represented in each room and then attendees join based upon who they want to talk to about jobs.  Alternatively, people will choose a topic to represent the breakout room and attendees join based upon what topics they wish to discuss as a group. There's no presenter/leader.  There is a group chat based upon the selected topic.</p>\n<p>There are obviously many ways to organize this, but these are the ones I've experienced.</p>",
