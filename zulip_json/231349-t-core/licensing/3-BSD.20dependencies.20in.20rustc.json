Outside of some Fuchsia-specific dependencies we do not allow dependencies to have this license, and the license explicitly asks that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...but I don't think we're currently doing this. What is our current policy for this, and how should I proceed here?</p>",
