Some mir opts are using debug printing, some have more complex debugging systems, others have none. I thing we should figure out a generic framework that allows inspecting the mir opt state without having to modify the mir opt's source all the time. There should also be some connection between the state and the original source code and the mir statement that is being processed. I have no real clue how this would look, but I think we should have something in this space. A good starting example could be <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/7346#issuecomment-878237257\">clippy's clone lint</a>, which isn't complex per se, but it can still be hard to figure out what's going on in more complex examples</p>",
