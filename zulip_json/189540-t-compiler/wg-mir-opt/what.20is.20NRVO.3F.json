Someone more knowledgeable will correct me if I am :).</p>\n<p>Take this example: <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57077\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57077</a><br>\nYou can see that in the generated assembly for <code>call_by_val</code></p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>    lea rdi, [rsp + 16]\n    call    qword ptr [rip + SomeExternFun@GOTPCREL]\n    movups  xmm0, xmmword ptr [rsp + 80]\n    movaps  xmmword ptr [rsp + 160], xmm0\n    movups  xmm0, xmmword ptr [rsp + 16]\n    movups  xmm1, xmmword ptr [rsp + 32]\n    movups  xmm2, xmmword ptr [rsp + 48]\n    movups  xmm3, xmmword ptr [rsp + 64]\n    movaps  xmmword ptr [rsp + 144], xmm3\n    movaps  xmmword ptr [rsp + 128], xmm2\n    movaps  xmmword ptr [rsp + 112], xmm1\n    movaps  xmmword ptr [rsp + 96], xmm0\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>This is essentially a <code>memcpy</code> happening here. The memory space at <code>rsp+16</code> is passed to the external function and the memory from <code>rsp+16</code> to <code>rsp+96</code> is copied to <code>rsp+96</code>-<code>rsp+176</code>. If you think about it the optimisation that we can do here is to simply pass the memory once as the memory representation is the same and the copying of memory is unnecessary.</p>\n<p>If you look at the <code>call_by_ref</code> you can see that it doesnt do this unnecessary copy.</p>\n<p>If you try this same example in the playground today, you will not get a memcpy (both <code>call_by_ref</code> and <code>call_by_val</code> would be same).</p>\n<p>Therefore, this has been fixed by the  Return Value Optimisation.</p>",
