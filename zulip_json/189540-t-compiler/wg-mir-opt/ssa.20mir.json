Would it be an idea to for each local store which if the local has one defining use, or multiple defining uses or has it's address taken? This would be a kind of hybrid SSA form, except without phi nodes. It would allow for easier copy propagation on locals with only a single defining use and ignoring locals with their address taken completely for certain optimizations. It may also allow for removing Storage* for all locals that don't have their address taken without hurting release mode codegen (I hope LLVM is smart enough). This would also reduce the total number of Storage* that may interfere with mir optimizations.</p>",
