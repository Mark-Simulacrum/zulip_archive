My only new proposal is that <code>Visitor</code> and <code>MutVisitor</code> should diverge here. Creating \"fake places\" for <code>MutVisitor</code>s is bad, since they have to figure out whether a <code>Place</code> is a fake or not. I want to keep <code>MutVisitor</code> as close to the actual structure MIR as possible and continue to have <code>visit_local</code>, but tweak<code>Visitor</code> to make it more obvious how to write correct analysis passes.</p>",
