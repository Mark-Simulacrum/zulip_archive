As part of adding that to the PR, I'd also like to change the names of the MIR phases to be in past tense, ie <code>Built</code>, <code>ConstsPromoted</code>, <code>DropsLowered</code>, <code>GeneratorsLowered</code>, <code>Optimized</code> (not sure about <code>Const</code>, but I also don't know what that phase actually is). This seems clearer to me, since the phases are all entered when the thing they are named after completes. Would people be ok with this change? Is there some competing mental model here under which the current naming makes more sense?</p>",
