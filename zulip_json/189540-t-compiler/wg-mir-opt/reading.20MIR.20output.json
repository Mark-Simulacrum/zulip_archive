In the docs there is a statement that says String(s) implement Deref which causes String to inherit all of str's methods.  From the code example, it's demonstrated that a String can produce/spawn &amp;str(s) without explicitly implementing Deref.  So, I'm trying to read the MIR dump to see how this happens. Further, if a String which has the attributes: ptr, bytes(backing array) and capacity and a str has ptr and length which are descriptors of some \"backing array\" then what I would like to describe are the distinctions and commonalities between String and str.  And even examine the question:  Is there a str inside of String?  I know the answer to this should be \"it's complicated\", but it would be super helpful to read the MIR dump.  That information helps me to see where and maybe how the conversions from &amp;str to String and back again occur in this code snippet and gain insight into exactly what the compiler instructions are.  I don't know if this makes sense, but it is as I understand things.</p>",

As my goal here is to ask for help in learning how to read MIR output, I probably shouldn't have taken the bait on why I needed to know something that I was asking for help to learn.  Both you and Jonas are making points that are appreciated, but not relevant to my reason for reaching out and I apologize for the tangent.  The topic of my post is reading MIR output.  I think I'll just have to be less lazy web and figure it out.  :-)  Thanks, truly, for your time.<br>\n<a href=\"https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/mir/index.html\">https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/mir/index.html</a></p>",
