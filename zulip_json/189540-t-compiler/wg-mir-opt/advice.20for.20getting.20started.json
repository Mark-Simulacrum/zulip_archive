If you prefer building something new, there is the general idea of a peephole optimization framework (<a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/86525\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/86525</a>). If you'd rather start out with something small, there is <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/85180\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/85180</a> which should make writing opts easier.</p>\n<p>Or if you have your own ideas, please don't hesitate to bring them up.</p>",
