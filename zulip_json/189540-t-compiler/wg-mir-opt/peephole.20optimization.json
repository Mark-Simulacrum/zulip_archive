This leads to more inefficient code and more ir to churn through for llvm. While llvm is able to turn it into SSA using the mem2reg pass, this doesn't happen for <code>-Copt-level=0</code>, which is the default. This means that cg_llvm generates slower code in debug mode than necessary. cg_clif is able to directly turn it into SSA form on the fly using cranelift_frontend, which uses an algorithm based on \"Simple and Efficient Construction of Static Single Assignment Form\" (<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/76998f0404d83f1c303887c5fd207e14a07dcf4c/cranelift/frontend/src/ssa.rs\">cranelift source</a>)</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">pub</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">fn</span> <span class=\"nf\">a</span><span class=\"p\">()</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>-&gt; <span class=\"kt\">u8</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"kd\">let</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">mut</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">;</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">;</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"LLVM\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">define</span> <span class=\"k\">i8</span> <span class=\"vg\">@_ZN7example1a17ha389e3fd0a4f8f11E</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"k\">unnamed_addr</span> <span class=\"vg\">#0</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"nv\">%a</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">alloca</span> <span class=\"k\">i8</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"k\">align</span> <span class=\"m\">1</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">store</span> <span class=\"k\">i8</span> <span class=\"m\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"k\">i8</span><span class=\"p\">*</span> <span class=\"nv\">%a</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"k\">align</span> <span class=\"m\">1</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">store</span> <span class=\"k\">i8</span> <span class=\"m\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"k\">i8</span><span class=\"p\">*</span> <span class=\"nv\">%a</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"k\">align</span> <span class=\"m\">1</span>\n  <span class=\"nv nv-Anonymous\">%0</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">load</span> <span class=\"k\">i8</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"k\">i8</span><span class=\"p\">*</span> <span class=\"nv\">%a</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"k\">align</span> <span class=\"m\">1</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">ret</span> <span class=\"k\">i8</span> <span class=\"nv nv-Anonymous\">%0</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>function u0:0() -&gt; i8 system_v {\n                                block0:\n                                    nop\n                                    jump block1\n\n                                block1:\n                                    nop\n@0001                               v0 = iconst.i8 0\n@0002                               v1 = iconst.i8 1\n@0003                               v2 = iconst.i8 1\n@0005                               return v2\n}\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>As for the speed difference.
