Mostly in no-one is reviewing them (in depth). I am not sure how to proceed. I am currently only working on Rust part time and 2 of my 5h per day (4d/w) are already consumed by reviews. Add in some meetings, and I got around 8h/w that I have left, and I'm using those for developing type alias impl trait so we can finally have impl trait in trait method return types. We can either just go ahead and merge these just based on their mir-opt changes (and leave them in mir-opt-level 3, move them to unsound mir opts if any issues are opened) and not really review the logic in depth (unless anyone finds the time). Or we can just close everything that touches mir opts and isn't an easily reviewed 10 line change.</p>",

Perhaps I should try to clean up the branch and land the first commit or two which I think were necessary prerequisites to enabling the inliner by default. I can close the PR after that.</p>",
