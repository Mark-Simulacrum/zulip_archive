I recently published a <a href=\"https://ecstaticmorse.net/posts/quantifier-elimination/\">blog post</a> describing a strategy for reducing higher-ranked trait bounds to unquantified region constraints. It's a response to <a href=\"https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/01/21/hereditary-harrop-region-constraints/\">\"Polonius and the case of the hereditary harrop predicate\"</a>, although that post is quite old and may not reflect the current thinking around HRTBs. Even if some or all of my ideas are already known to the Polonius team, the blog post may still be useful since I was able to find relevant prior art that I haven't seen discussed anywhere, specifically some results on precedence constraints in atomic Boolean algebras showing a limit on how powerful our region logic can be while remaining decidable.</p>\n<p>I had these ideas back when I was making some trivial fixes to get up to speed with Polonius. I was hesitant to share them at the time because I was both unsure about their novelty and worried I had made a trivial mistake somewhere: I'm an amateur mathematician and a lousy one at that. I had planned to start with a more concrete proposal about using a variant of the SSA transformation to speed up computing borrow errors, but that idea turned out to have a fatal flaw. Partly because of that negative result and partly because of some health problems, I stopped working on Polonius in my free time. Now that I'm feeling better, however, it seemed wasteful not to publish my results despite the possibility of a minor embarrassment.</p>",

That's good to know. AFAICT, the main problem is disjunction inside a universal quantifier. We don't have to deal with negation, so we can convert to disjunctive normal form using only the distributive law, and existential quantifiers distribute over disjunction. I don't know how to prove statements like <code>forall&lt;'x&gt; { 'x : 'a || 'a : 'x }</code>, however. It might not be an issue like you said.</p>",

In our case, the atomic elements are all sets containing only a single loan.  Algebras that have such elements are atomic, and those that don't are atomless.  Atomless boolean algebras have quantifier elimination for equality and inequality, but maybe not order constraints? Also, powerset are not atomless, so I dismissed them initially.</p>\n<p>However, this logic is specifically for <em>placeholder</em> regions, which represent something like \"all possible loans in any caller\". Unlike with the concrete sets of loans at the heart of Polonius, we can't name an atomic placeholder region. A placeholder with exactly one more loan than <code>'static</code> is nonsensical. Perhaps this means that we could leverage the QE algorithm for atomless boolean algebras for restricted HRTBs somehow? I think a proper mathematician would be able to accept or reject this idea very quickly.</p>\n<h2>Boolean Algebras and Presburger Artithmetic (BAPA)</h2>\n<p>As I mentioned in my blog post, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjy3oTnqJz0AhVXjp4KHTc5DpsQFnoECAIQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fciteseerx.ist.psu.edu%2Fviewdoc%2Fdownload%3Fdoi%3D10.1.1.101.3825%26rep%3Drep1%26type%3Dpdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Nyu7LBN55wRABgoMi0G8B\">Revesz</a> shows that if you extend the simple subset constraints with integer constraints on the cardinality of sets, the extended system does have QE. This was discovered independently by <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiKnf2tqZz0AhXKrZ4KHTPzCsMQFnoECAUQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flara.epfl.ch%2F~kuncak%2Fpapers%2FKuncakETAL05AlgorithmDecidingBAPA.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw0aV6Ww1g22lhcXl1SME0K9\">Kuncak et al.</a>, who also implemented the algorithm in OCaml.</p>\n<p>I strongly recommend that you <a href=\"https://github.com/epfl-lara/jahob/blob/e1f8f5a830bed85f881b4173f2c83752b3709e74/src/bapa/alpha.ml#L863-L899\">read their test cases</a>, although if you try to run them (e.g. <code>process example2</code>), you'll get a very confusing set of constraints on variables with names like <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>l</mi><mn>01</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">l_{01}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8444em;vertical-align:-0.15em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.01968em;\">l</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.3011em;\"><span style=\"top:-2.55em;margin-left:-0.0197em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">01</span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">​</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.15em;\"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>. You'll need  to read the paper to understand their meaning. By the way, if you think abstract algebra is hard, wait til you try to run a multi-file OCaml program. I have now learned about Dune (the sci-fi epic) and <code>dune</code> (the build system) in the span of a month.</p>\n<p>The basic idea is to convert subset constraints such as <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>⊆</mo><mi>b</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">a \\subseteq b</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.7719em;vertical-align:-0.136em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">a</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">⊆</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6944em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">b</span></span></span></span> into equivalent ones in term of cardinality, in this case <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">∣</mi><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>b</mi><mo>ˉ</mo></mover><mo>∩</mo><mi>a</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">∣</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">|\\bar{b} \\cap a| = 0</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1.0812em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">∣</span><span class=\"mord accent\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.8312em;\"><span style=\"top:-3em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:3em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">b</span></span><span style=\"top:-3.2634em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:3em;\"></span><span class=\"accent-body\" style=\"left:-0.25em;\"><span class=\"mord\">ˉ</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span><span class=\"mbin\">∩</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">a</span><span class=\"mord\">∣</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">=</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">0</span></span></span></span>. After this rewriting )along with some clever transformations), you get a statement in the Presburger arithmetic, which has a well known decision algorithm. This statement may have grown exponentially from the initial statement in BAPA, however. </p>\n<p>This approach transforms simple subset relationships into complex cardinality relationships on combinations of those sets. We'd have to translate these back to subset relationships somehow, presumably emitting an error when one of the cardinality constraints was not translatable. This would obviously be pretty complex. But before I gave up on this approach, I saw this little gem, citing <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwikhJ6Mrpz0AhVEpZ4KHRUTA5QQFnoECAUQAQ&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fmatwbn.icm.edu.pl%2Fksiazki%2Ffm%2Ffm47%2Ffm4715.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw1t6nFDafvTYgZKRaLrzTQA\">Feferman and Vaught</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The argument above also explains why we attribute the decidability of BAPA to [14, Section 8], which showed the decidability of BA over sets extended with the equicardinality relation ∼, using the decidability of the first-order theory of the addition of<br>\ncardinal numbers</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We don't need the full richness of linear cardinality constraints, so it's possible that a system with only equicardinality constraints would be easier to map onto Polonius. Once again, if quantifier elimination generated in a bogus equicardinality constraint on two distinct free variables, it would be an error. I haven't read the cited paper in depth, however.</p>",
