I've been completely floored by various other stuff, including distance teaching and haven't had time or energy to work on much of anything beyond that.</p>",

I just joined this stream a few days ago after reading up more on Polonius following some StackOverflow post where it appeared. Since most of the activity around it seemed some time ago with little that was recent (also no current meeting in the calendar), I was somewhat unsure about the status of the project (which this post clears up a lot), but I've been looking for a fitting way to contribute to Rust for a little while, and I'd be very interested to have this way be through Polonius. </p>\n<p>Would You say that with your current situation as You describe you could see this a way to move forward, or is it more like there are certain things _You_ need to get done and getting me up to speed would need additional time which you don't have at the moment? I have some experience with logic-based programming, though more academical than practical, but do have practical experience with Rust outside of rustc.</p>",
