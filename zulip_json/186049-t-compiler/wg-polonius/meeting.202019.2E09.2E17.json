        "content": "<p>Hi everyone! I am probably not going to be able to attend the meeting, but I figured I could write a quick report anyway. I'm mainly working on the presentation for my thesis and [non-Polonius stuff]. Once The Great Renaming and my Other Things have settled down, I figure I'll go into fixing Niko's concerns about initialisation to make the tracking of move paths precise. For that, I would need some way to do verification, for example the Rust unit tests with Polonius (that I don't know how to run).</p>\n<p>After that comes move errors, which I have code for in pencil on a sheet of paper somewhere. To unblock that would also require some way of verifying it (passing the results on to rustc and running the compiler's unit tests?), and a decision on how to report errors  that are not invalidation x live loans-errors (that is, the current set of errors). Of course, I can just make something up and fix it retroactively.</p>\n<p>Other things I would like to work on in the reasonably near future is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>moving my benchmarking script into the Polonius runner, possibly with the help of the Rust profiling tools, adding a CLI option like <code>--benchmark-facts</code> that would change Polonius' behaviour to take a path containing nll-facts for a number of crates, and produce results like <code>crate_folder_name,fn_name,initialisation_runtime,liveness_runtime,loan_vilations_runtime</code>, or something like that.</li>\n<li>refactoring Polonius to split up the facts into separate structs for the three steps so that you can e.g. run Hybrid without re-computing initialisation and liveness twice in the worst case</li>\n<li>clean up the fact generation code and in particular collect all the MIR walkers in one place</li>\n<li>documenting liveness and initialisation, once they settle down a bit, in the book</li>\n<li>re-implementing the benchmarking instrumentation, but both in Polonius and the fact-generation code in Rust.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My idea is to make sure we start early with instrumenting things for benchmarking to reduce the temptation of doing premature optimisations based on no data when someone inevitably comes up with a \"probably better way of doing this\". Also, that this is something I can work on relatively independently and burn as little other person's time and attention as possible while still being productive.</p>",
