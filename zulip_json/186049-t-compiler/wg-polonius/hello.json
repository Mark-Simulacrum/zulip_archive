I had a look at the different WGs available (thanks to the hints t-compiler/learning-wg) and finally ended up here as of considering the idea of Polonius quite interesting but also as of a personal interest in type systems and programming languages as well as LP (Prolog and ASP so far). </p>\n<p>In terms of actual contributions, I think on the code side I could start out with having a look (and hopefully fixing) issues from github - this probably also helps me better learning the existing code base. however, if necessary I'd be happy to also help out on the organisational side - I think this should also allow me to grasp a better overall picture of the WG and its workings/duties</p>",
