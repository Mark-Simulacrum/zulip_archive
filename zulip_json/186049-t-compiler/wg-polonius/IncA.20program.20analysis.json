I am one of the developers of the IncA program analysis framework (<a href=\"https://github.com/szabta89/IncA\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/szabta89/IncA\">https://github.com/szabta89/IncA</a>).  I met with Niko back in November at OOPSLA, and we had a chat about the Rust borrow checker implementation in Datalog. I was in contact recently with Frank McSherry, and he mentioned that custom lattices with aggregation may be something that is interesting for your use cases. These are not standard features in Datalog, but IncA does support them, and it does that incrementally, so that the analysis result can be kept up to date as the input changes. I am here to find out if this is really interesting to you. Cheers, Tamas</p>",

We've not thought too much yet about how to do that, but perhaps it is something that custom lattices might help with.</p>",
