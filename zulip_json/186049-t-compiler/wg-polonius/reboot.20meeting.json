(This one being half over.) Or maybe we can just discuss in this thread a bit async?</p>\n<p>For my part:</p>\n<p>I'm still interested in keeping polonius on a \"light boil\" -- I probably won't have a ton of time to devote, but I'm happy we're still making progress. I can and will do the reviews of the initialization PRs, for example. </p>\n<p>I still think the overall plan we've been following makes sense:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>move the remainder of borrow check into polonius</li>\n<li>start to optimize for performance after that</li>\n</ul>",
