So I'd definitely try to make time available - it feels like I've just recently gotten to the point where my out-of-work time is not all taken up <br>\nby moving and organizing and getting my new home set up anymore, so there are reasons to be carefully optimistic. That said I probably won't be able to make our previous meeting time (at least, if time zones/summer time doesn't help me out here), since it's unrealistic that I'm back from work in time.</p>",

I've been doing some <a href=\"https://leanprover.github.io/about/\">Lean</a> and enjoying post-Omicron, pre-BA.2 life here in the States.</p>\n<p>To sum up from my POV for <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"337115\">Domenic Quirl</span>, I did a bit of research into type systems with subtyping constraints (<code>for&lt;'a, 'b&gt; where 'a : 'b fn (&amp;'a &amp;'b)</code>) (see <a href=\"https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/drop/tapos-final.pdf\">\"Type Inference with Constrained Types\"</a>) and implemented a <a href=\"https://github.com/ecstatic-morse/hrtb-logic/blob/main/src/tests.rs#L97-L100\">toy solver</a> for some of the subtyping constraints we have in Rust (it doesn't break down functions yet).</p>\n<p>It seemed like the next logical step was to integrate this into Chalk, but I wasn't detecting much enthusiasm for this type of thing. Maybe I went wrong somewhere? IIRC, Chalk didn't have a way of distinguishing between existentially and universally quantified lifetime/type variables in the way that I needed. Even if I loaded this all back into cache, I would likely need a lot of help from <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116009\">@nikomatsakis</span> or <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"232957\">@Jack Huey</span> to even get started, and I figured the traits team has  other, more pressing stuff on their plate. That said, it seems Polonius is on the roadmap for 2024, so maybe <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"116009\">nikomatsakis</span> has more time to devote to it?</p>\n<p>Also, it seems like the \"core\" of Polonius is maybe less settled than I had first though. <code>.next</code> sort of came out of nowhere (I was hoping to do more implementation than ideation, despite the above paragraph), and it seems like <a href=\"#narrow/stream/186049-t-compiler.2Fwg-polonius/topic/Hackathon.20in.202022/near/277974688\">there may be more changes in the pipeline</a>. I'm not sure how useful I would be for that. Frankly, I didn't contribute much to the <code>.next</code> discussions.</p>\n<p>At some point I wrote the frontend of an in-memory, Rust-native Datalog engine with the hopes that we could write future analyses passes in it. I love Souffle, but it has a very poor FFI interface and some of the more advanced features (aggregates) are buggy. I might try to finish that if I get back into Rust. I've learned that, if I'm going to work for free <span aria-label=\"sweat smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f605\" role=\"img\" title=\"sweat smile\">:sweat_smile:</span> , I want to do it in my own repo, or at least one that doesn't require reviewer sign-off before being merged upstream. I feel bad taking up reviewer time, and I find the delays and rebasing demoralizing.</p>",
