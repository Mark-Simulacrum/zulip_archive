It now seems that there are at least two MIR Visitors, one in invalidation (which is Polonius-specific as far as I can tell?), and one that I use in the liveness submodule (incorrectly placed, as it does other things than liveness, and somewhat oddly positioned in the tree as it doesn't require the liveness inputs anymore).</p>",
