I wanted to be able to run the <code>rustc</code> test suite in a reasonable amount of time and evaluate which features should be ported into datafrog.  Obviously liveness is no longer needed for <code>polonius.next</code>, so this is less important, but it still interests me. I thought it would be useful for other types of prototyping as well, since you don't need to do variable indexing yourself.</p>",
