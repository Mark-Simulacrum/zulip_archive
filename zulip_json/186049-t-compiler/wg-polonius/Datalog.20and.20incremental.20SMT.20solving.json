They call this tactic CSA.</p>\n<p>This lets the solver cache a lot, without really caring about the order in which we explore paths, and gives a speedup in 79 of 105 total experiments (over non-incremental baseline), being surpassed by a simple stack-based backtrace (named PP; using the assertion stack with <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code>) in 7 experiments.<br>\nIn 2 of the 7, CSA did not improve over baseline, while PP did. In the other 5 experiments, both improved on baseline, but PP did a better job.<br>\nFor symbolic execution, incremental was always better, and 12 of 18 cases were won by CSA.<br>\nFor refinement-types type-checking, CSA won for all 3 input programs (improving over baseline and delivering the best improvements).<br>\nThe random graph tests went mostly-good, with about half of the cases where incremental solving did not deliver an improvement used a logic combining linear integer arithmetic (_not_ bit vector logic) with arrays.</p>",
