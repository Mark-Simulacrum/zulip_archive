(Niko might not be able to attend either IIRC). In any case, here's my async update for this week (<code>self.update().await</code>): I didn't have time to do more work on the rustc test suite results, unfortunately :/ I mostly spent it preparing the NLL crater runs and triaging the first one (the 2nd one is almost done but has been delayed).</p>",
