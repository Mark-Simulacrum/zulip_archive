I have worked on initialisation, including cleaning it up and implementing move error reporting in Polonius. I opened a PR (<a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/polonius/issues/135\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/polonius/issues/135\">polonius#135</a>), which contains  both a list of things left to do and a high-level description of what I did.</p>",
