In discussions with <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"127262\">@Aaron Weiss</span> we settled on a few possible names. These all come from the intuition that a region in Polonius is equivalent to a <em>set of loans</em> -- i.e., it describes the possible places that the reference could have originated. That suggests various names like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provenance -- often used to describe the source of a pointer in \"the literature\"</li>\n<li>Origin</li>\n<li>Source</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This all connects nicely to the form of explanation that says <code>fn foo&lt;'a&gt;(data: &amp;'a T) -&gt; &amp;'a U</code> means that the return value is \"borrowed from <code>data</code>\".</p>",
