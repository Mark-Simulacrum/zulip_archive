(Write down all the modules or types you contribute to) &lt;- Maybe just a big checklist here?</li>\n<li>How would you rate your level of expertise with these areas?</li>\n<li>Would you like to be pinged/involved with any changes to these areas?</li>\n<li>What platforms do you work on?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think there was a contributor survey that went out a little while ago (can't remember exactly what was on it <span aria-label=\"sweat smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f605\" role=\"img\" title=\"sweat smile\">:sweat_smile:</span>). But the idea here being trying to get an idea of what areas of std we have experts in and using that to bootstrap an experts map. Alternatives could be to look at git history or even just ask for volunteers <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>",
