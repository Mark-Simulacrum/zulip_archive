Our next meeting will include a retrospective by the members who have participated.  Then we plan to discuss next steps which will likely include recording future sessions.  I'll know more after we complete the retro.</p>\n<p>Another general interest event is planned for our next RRC on Feb 3rd.  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116083\">@pnkfelix</span> has graciously agreed to do a demo of Pernosco for the group.  He plans to record the demo and post it to his YouTube channel.  It will be available for everyone to watch and learn from.</p>\n<p>I'll update here following the retrospective on Feb 3rd.  Stay tuned!</p>",
