But <a href=\"https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps//blog/2021/11/18/rustc-reading-club-take-2\">as I described here</a>, it's clear there's a lot of interest in reading clubs and I'd like to see more clubs happening in the future. </p>\n<p>One comment is if you're a rustc hacker who'd like to help in running their own club, please reach out to <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"394977\">@Doc Jones</span> and I. Alternatively, if people want to read together on a more ad-hoc basis, you can always make a zoom room or google hangouts or what have you and give it a try!</p>",

I'm happy to hear that you are interested in the club. Unfortunately, your timing is a bit off. As a result of the overwhelming attendance we had for the 1st session, it became clear that we needed to reduce attendance to a manageable size group.  The current iteration of the Rustc Reading Club is invite only.  Don't there will be more Rust Reading Clubs starting some time in early 2022.  A few people have stepped forward to lead those so we will have the chance to participate if you want it.</p>",
