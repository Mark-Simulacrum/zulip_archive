This might be as small as trying to add some more documentation to parts of code we've read through, or finding some task related to the name resolver. However, I'm still not confident in my abilities to handle the full contribution process: I don't know what's expected of a PR, how the \"language\" of compiler contributions work, and if I could even add something meaningful that isn't just bloat.</p>\n<p>I had an idea of something that might help reduce this barrier for new contributors. A session (either part of the reading club or a different initiative if need be) where there are one or more leaders, and several participants of different skill levels. Using a tool like VS Code Liveshare could allow this group to peer program together. The participants could see the code diff as they go, the leaders could suggest improvements on parts of code, and the commit can include each of the participants as a \"collaborator\" (tracked by their email). Then each participant could be part of the PR process, and have their first commit to the main repo.</p>\n<p>This is more or less just brainstorming, but I wanted to just mention it since I'd love to see new contributors coming from these reading clubs :) (a proper graduation!)</p>",
