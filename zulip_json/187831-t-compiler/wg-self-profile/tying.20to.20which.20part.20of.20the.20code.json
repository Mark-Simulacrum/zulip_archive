They expressed a desire (that I think many of us have) to be able to gain more insight into what parts of their code are causing compilation time explosions. This was an initial goal for the self-profile work. I was wondering if anybody had thought more about it in the meantime?</p>\n<p>They also were having trouble finding the docs. As far as I know, the docs are still basically on the measureme crate, right? Maybe we can add some kind of pointer to <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/index.html\">the rustc book</a>, this seems like a feature that a lot of people would have an interest in.</p>",
