I ended up finding a bit of a roundabout method to do it but was curious, is there a better way nowadays to correlate CGUs in cros with actual bitcode files?</p>",

I suppose there's no much to do it, but does anyone want to take a look? I haven't seen many of these profiles, so perhaps there's something interesting in there.
