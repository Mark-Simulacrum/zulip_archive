According to the <a href=\"https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization\" title=\"https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization\">GitHub docs</a>, it grants the following permissions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apply labels (Useful for <code>P-*</code>, <code>I-prioritize</code>, regressions...)</li>\n<li>Close, reopen, and assign all issues and pull requests (Useful for assigning people to work on issues when it is deemed necessary)</li>\n<li>Apply milestones (Maybe usefull for defining release blockers?)</li>\n<li>Mark duplicate issues and pull requests (Would probably be done by T-release folks)</li>\n<li>Request pull request reviews (pretty much useless because we have <code>r?</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>So to me the question is: should we always let leaders assign those labels, which would make sense as they \"represent\" the WG and are responsible for the final decisions? Or should we give those permissions to all members so everyone can do it in case leaders are AFK/unavailible, or maybe just because is isn't fun for one person to always do the work.</p>\n<p>cc <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116266\">@Santiago Pastorino</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"125250\">@Wesley Wiser</span></p>",
