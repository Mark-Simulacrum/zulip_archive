As in issues are opened and generally closed when a PR lands on master. We don’t keep them open because they are not yet on beta, stable. Following this reasoning, this is not critical anymore on master. We do track beta/stable backports with nominations and this is already nominated and accepted. But what I find great about this conversation is that we clearly need to define something that makes more sense for everyone and works 😊</p>",
