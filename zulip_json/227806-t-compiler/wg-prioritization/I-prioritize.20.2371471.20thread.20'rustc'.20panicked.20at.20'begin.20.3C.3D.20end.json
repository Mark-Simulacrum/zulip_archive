        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116266\">@Santiago Pastorino</span> I think we may want to actually prioritize this? It causes things that aren't shebangs (because it's not actually the first line of the file) to be interpreted as a shebang (which then is ignored by the rust compiler). It seems like it _could_ break actual valid code in weird cases although I can't think of anything off the top of my head. It would have to begin with <code>#!</code> but have a third character that wasn't <code>[</code> which is explicitly checked for</p>",
