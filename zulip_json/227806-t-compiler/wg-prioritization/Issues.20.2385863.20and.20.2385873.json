So mostly a T-libs question, not necessarily too relevant for T-lang? Although this example might be valuable in a general guideline on what to keep in mind around specialization, and T-lang is relevant for the ongoing design of sound specialization. I don’t know…</p>\n<p>maybe regarding my proposed</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>if, somehow, specialization would also consider types such as fn(&amp;()) and fn(&amp;'static ()) to be “the same type”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>fix. Which – by the way – seems less reasonable to me now than it felt when I created the issue, and I found that <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/56105\">#56105</a> is probably relevant around any potential discussion for considering this option. Anyway, <em>in case</em> this is seen as a reasonable approach to fix these issues, then T-lang would become very relevant.</p>",
