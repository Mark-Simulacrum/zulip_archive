All I want to do at this point is try some stuff out locally. But I’m struggling to even figure out how to properly test <code>collector::execute::rustc</code> locally. Just doing <code>./target/release/collector bench_local /path/to/rustc  a_name_i_made  --include rustc</code> runs that code, but I’m having trouble finding a version of <code>rustc</code> that’s compatible with the <code>rust.git</code> that the benchmarker checks out.</p>",
