On my machine, it takes about 10 seconds to compile <code>future</code> and other dependencies but the crate itself compiles in &lt; 1 second after projection caching was re-added (and longer than 30 minutes prior to the caching). </p>\n<p>My understanding is that for benchmarking, we compile the dependencies once and then repeatedly clean and build just the final crate being benchmarked. Are these build times reasonable for a new benchmark?</p>",
