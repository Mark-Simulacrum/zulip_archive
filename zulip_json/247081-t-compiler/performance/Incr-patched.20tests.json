I'm guessing that's because maybe the people there don't know the details of the compiling time performance test suite.</p>\n<p>Anywho, the question is: Why do some projects in <code>perf.rlo</code> not have <code>incr-patched</code> tests? I'm curious to know if those projects just aren't interesting to test in those circumstances, or if it was another reason like prioritization of resources on projects that showed more interesting performance nuances when patched.</p>\n<p>Thanks! <span aria-label=\"heart\" class=\"emoji emoji-2764\" role=\"img\" title=\"heart\">:heart:</span></p>",
