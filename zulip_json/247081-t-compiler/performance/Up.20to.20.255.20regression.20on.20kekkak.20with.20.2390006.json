It introduces a bit of work to <em>every</em> binary operation (+-/&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&gt;==!=), which can be translated to a big regression in the kekkak perf test. Because of the way inference has to work there, it is hard to <em>avoid</em> that cost in the happy path (but I think there are things that <em>could</em> be done to do so, it's just time intensive, something I'm lacking lately).</p>",
