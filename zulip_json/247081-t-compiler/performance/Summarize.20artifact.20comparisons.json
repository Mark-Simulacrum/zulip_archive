Previously we tried to filter out artifact comparisons that likely don't require investigation. </p>\n<p>However, this means we'll be showing artifact comparisons that are clearly not worth investigating. For example, <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/95610\">this PR</a> has <a href=\"https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=168a0209002fef203e83989ff641c1b3e1a51859&amp;end=2ad4eb207b369017f5140918b5e4b0d3650b46b0\">this artifact comparison</a>. The PR is a small change to a trait doc. The artifact comparison shows 1 small regression to a secondary benchmark that, given the change, is likely just noise. </p>\n<p>I think we should be doing something to help users who might not be very used to ready artifact comparisons understand how to interpret the results. We've now gone back to not really helping them at all.</p>",
