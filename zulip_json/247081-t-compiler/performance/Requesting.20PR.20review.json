I'm back now and still interested in getting these merged. <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/1225\">#1225</a> especially seems like it should be uncontroversial. Could someone have a look and let me know if there's still work to be done? <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116122\">@simulacrum</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"224872\">@rylev</span> Or let me know who I should ping to get this looked at? Thanks! :)</p>",
