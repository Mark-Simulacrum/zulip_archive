Although for new PRs it probably won't help by itself, since I won't have <code>try</code> permissions, but I already have it for my BOLT PR, so I could use it as a CI perf testbed of sorts.</p>",

We don't have a great strategy for granting these to 'new' contributors just yet; but in general, you shouldn't feel bad about poking for a perf run on an as-needed basis (there's a standing thread in <a class=\"stream-topic\" data-stream-id=\"182449\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/182449-t-compiler.2Fhelp/topic/perf.20run\">#t-compiler/help &gt; perf run</a>  I believe).</p>",
