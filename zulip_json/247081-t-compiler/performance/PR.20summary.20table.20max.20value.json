For example <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/95555#issuecomment-1087365963\">here</a>, it shows <code>0.4</code>, even though one could argue that the max change was actually <code>-2.0%</code>. Should we change it so that it shows the largest change in either positive or negative direction? Now that I look at it the current value looks completely wrong.</p>",
