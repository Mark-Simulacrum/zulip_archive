This PR showed up in the weekly <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/tree/master/triage\">perf triage</a> report. It resulted in a moderate improvement in <a href=\"https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=8e9d5db8392c44a2e94008168fa3506ecddaa357&amp;end=b3aae050cd7e0c9a9eb6085bd49b02f67dc1396f&amp;stat=instructions:u\">instruction counts</a> (up to -1.0% on <code>incr-patched: Compiler new</code> builds of <code>regex-opt</code>).</p>\n<p>This seems to have been a very small win across the board, including <code>rustdoc</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116122\">@simulacrum</span> does that make any sense to you?</p>",
