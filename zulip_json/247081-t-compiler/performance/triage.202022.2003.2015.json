It definitely makes quick analysis much easier</li>\n<li>Also awesome to see so many folks in <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"247081\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/247081-t-compiler.2Fperformance\">#t-compiler/performance</a> involved in PRs that make the compiler faster. Good work all! </li>\n<li>On the negative side: all regressions were in rollups - we continue to allow too many regressions in through rollups IMO</li>\n</ul>",
