I do think that hate and near constant wishing to swear at people are essential and very useful parts of my mindset, and I want to try to explain to you the reasoning behind it. You may find it impolite, but every time I stay silent, someone else speaks in my place, so here we go!. Buckle up.</p>\n<p>Communication between people is full of misunderstanding, and this is especially true for multinational communities. People talk different languages, they have different cultural backgrounds - oftentimes mutually offensive ones. The worst thing is, people don't make much effort to prevent it. </p>\n<p>Look: we are in FOOS world. People come here with various goals: some want to learn and develop their own skills, some strive for the glory and fame as creator of the brand new Linux, lots of people just have fun because they like to code. The list is not exhaustive, but what unites all of these goals is that they are <em>well intended</em>. Jerks that want to troll or sabotage others' work do exist, but they are <em>extremely rare</em>, like, 0.1% or something. So, imagine you saw something that looks offensive to you. What is the the most sensible course of action, considering that the ill intend is very unlikely?</p>\n<p>I think you should ask him \"Dude, I'm not sure I get it right. Mind explaining what you meant, exactly?\" Agreed?</p>\n<p>Now listen. I'm 21, I've had a computer since 14. How many times do you think I've observed people in the Internet act this way? I mean, before they snap at each other. 19 times. Only ninety times in seven years. Yes, I've been counting, I've been spending a lot of time throughout these years online, in a huge variety of places. But, you may ask, what do people do instead? </p>\n<p>They jump to conclusions.</p>\n<p>Just look at the comment above: spacekookie had read my commit about <em>imaginary scenario when I would want to tell people to fuck off (and I also suggested pksunkara to do the same since I think it helps cool down)</em>, she extrapolated it to the point that <em>I was going to really do that</em>, and she ended up with a polite suggestion to check if I want to keep performing as maintainer. Wonderful.</p>\n<p>You know what, people? Here is the deal: pick any of my comments in the clap repo - there are plenty of them - and, if it happens to contain <em>personal</em> insults, I'll step down effectively immediately. I'll still be sending PRs against clap, I'll still be participating in clap-related topics. The only difference will be that you won't be being offended by a maintainer anymore, weren't you?</p>\n<p>Now, let me get to my hate and my wishing to \"tell people to fuck off\".</p>\n<p>It's genuine. I hate a lot of things from the bottom of my black wicket heart. And it's fine - no, it's splendid! - as long as this hate is tamed.</p>\n<p>People are driven by emotions. They keep us going, keep us entertained, make us <em>do something</em>. Everybody experiences that - don't you wink at me, anonymous! You do, too. There is some kind of emotional drive behind most of my comments. What do you think I was thinking when I was writing <a href=\"https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/1707\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/1707\">those comments</a>? \"Kids should not be allowed in internet\", or something along the lines. <a href=\"https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/1731#issuecomment-596205056\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/1731#issuecomment-596205056\">This one</a> was backed by \"WTF dude, are you blind or something? The doc is few clicks away\". <a href=\"https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/1645\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/1645\">That issue</a> was totally about \"You're fucking reincarnation of Goldberg\". See the point? That was what I was <em>thinking</em>, seriously (maybe not literally, but the intent is correct). Now follow those links and see what I actually <em>wrote</em>. Note that I try to ask again whenever I'm not sure I understood the problem.</p>\n<p>To make this clear: I wasn't offended by any of those comments, not at all. The \"first thought contains profanity\" state is normal for me; it triggers hundred times each day. Actually, I've conducted a survey of sorts among my friends (which employed some amount of alcohol) and I've found that many of them feel the same; it's not just me. It's normal to feel miffed when you hear some nonsense (or you think so); what really matters is whether you react harshly or suppress the initial impulse and direct you emotions into something constructive.</p>\n<p>\"Creepy, why don't you work on your temper?\" Why would I? What's the problem? Hate is the brightest emotion I've even known. <del>It is also free.</del> Hate is what makes my comments so elaborative because I hate ignorance and I understand it won't dissolve on it's own and I try enlightening people with all my might. </p>\n<p>Do you know how I found my way to FOSS world? I was upset about <code>proc macro 'structopt' panicked with \"...\", go figure out in which line of 200 it is</code> messages. With time, I started to hate them, sincerely, and this hate eventually turned into \"I want it fixed no matter what\". <code>structopt</code> got nice error messages, others got <code>proc-macro-error</code> - nice proc macro errors for minimal effort, I redirected my hate somewhere else. Everybody's happy, and all thanks to hate. Without being constantly kicked by a strong emotion, I wouldn't make up my courage to go open source.</p>\n<p>Let's glue it together. </p>\n<p>People complain that dev community is toxic (it's not just you, I've heard it a lot) and they tend to explain it with the lack of politeness. Like, using \"thanks\" extensively and replacing \"What didn't you get?\" with \"Could you please explain what you didn't understand?\" will magically improve the situation. Well yes, to some extent. But kind words will never fill the emptiness and lack of concern behind them. Does it help you when you hear \"thanks to contacting our support!\"? I bet not much since you need a solution to a problem, not \"thanks\".</p>\n<p>When you see that some user posts weird stuff you find inappropriate, sinking your first impulse into reply will likely worsen the situation, and resorting to punishing will hurt immensely (recall the ActiX drama, which was based on misunderstanding). <strong>Give people some fucking credit!</strong> They probably didn't mean <em>that bad</em>. This is why projects \"go to shit real fast\", not because \"responses aren't friendly\", not only.</p>\n<p>Dear God, I'm very dissatisfied with this humanity. Elon Musk, how much for a ticket to the moon?</p>",
