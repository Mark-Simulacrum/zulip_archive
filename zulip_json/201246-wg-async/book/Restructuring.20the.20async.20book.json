Once they understand the fundamental concepts from the first section, the focus should be on getting to some working code/examples before introducing more advanced topics like cancelling futures. \"Async functions and blocks\" and \"avoiding blocking code\" seem important enough to introduce after the fundamentals, and before some of the other topics in \"writing async code\". Maybe we could add a section between \"fundamentals\" and \"writing async code\" that uses examples to introduce those two topics.</p>",
