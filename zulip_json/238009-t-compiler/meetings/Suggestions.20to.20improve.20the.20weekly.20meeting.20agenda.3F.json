From time to time we change small details based on our ideas, but we're not sure if our changes really help or if the agenda needs improvements at all. So, in order to work more \"on specs\" and less on \"sentiment\", we ask you if after the next meeting (no rush, when time allows) you can provide an actionable feedback on what would you like to see improved in the agenda that <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"116083\">pnkfelix</span> copy-pastes each week.</p>",
