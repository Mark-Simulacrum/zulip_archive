This is not super favorable to the rust project, so I'm hitting the highlights here in a less frustrated tone. Apologies for the wall of text.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Compile times are really bad, especially on first builds. <a href=\"#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/topic/improving.20bootstrap.20times.20for.20contributor.20fun.20and.20profit\">https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/topic/improving.20bootstrap.20times.20for.20contributor.20fun.20and.20profit</a> already discussed this a lot. The space taken for a compile is also really bad.</li>\n<li>Taking extensive knowledge of <code>git</code> as a prerequisite makes it a lot harder to contribute. I opened <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-dev-guide/issues/850\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-dev-guide/issues/850</a> for this, <span class=\"user-group-mention\" data-user-group-id=\"1380\">@WG-rustc-dev-guide</span> can fix this ourselves without too much trouble I think.</li>\n<li>The x.py defaults are meant for CI, not for contributors. <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues/326\">https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues/326</a> helped with this, but we should try not to have to recommend changes to <code>config.toml.example</code> in the dev guide.</li>\n<li>Review latency is bad. <a href=\"#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/topic/.22Review.20latency.20can.20be.20challenging.22\">https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/topic/.22Review.20latency.20can.20be.20challenging.22</a> talked about this, but I don't know that there were any changes as a result of the discussion.</li>\n<li>Merge conflicts are frustrating. This compounds with the <code>git</code> issues and review latency; it also doesn't help that the compiler changes so frequently.</li>\n<li>The dev-guide has room for improvements:<ul>\n<li>It could be organized better (will write this up in an issue at some point)</li>\n<li>It doesn't have enough information. In particular, a lot of knowledge seems to only live in the heads of contributors (e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-dev-guide/issues/836\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-dev-guide/issues/836</a>). We need more compiler members working on this, not just people from the working group.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Being able to build <code>libstd</code> with just <code>cargo build</code> and <code>cargo test</code> would make it a lot easier to get started.</li>\n<li>It's hard to find mentors. This compounds with 'knowledge only lives in the heads of contributors'.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some other pieces of knowledge:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New contributors definitely use CI rather than having to build locally</li>\n<li>First-time build times are a major issue, not just incremental builds</li>\n<li><code>S-waiting-for-help</code> would help new contributors the most. Maybe we should reconsider this?</li>\n<li>New contributors don't know <code>rustbot</code> exists and they can modify labels. I think this could be fixed by mentioning it in the highfive welcome message.</li>\n</ul>",
