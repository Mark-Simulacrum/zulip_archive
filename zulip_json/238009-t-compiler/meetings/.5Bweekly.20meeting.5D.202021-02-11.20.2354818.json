This will fix <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28728\">#28728</a>.</li>\n<li>Known <code>noalias</code> related miscompiles have been fixed by the introduction of <code>@llvm.experimental.noalias.scope.decl</code> intrinsics. There might be more issues lurking here, but at least the previous blocker is resolved now. This will fix <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54878\">#54878</a>.</li>\n<li>Incorrect nowrap flags in LSR have been fixed. This will fix <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74498\">#74498</a>.</li>\n<li>fptoui.sat/fptosi.sat intrinsics for saturating float to int conversions have landed. However currently only X86 has optimized codegen. We may switch to these sometime in the future, over the current manual expansion we do.</li>\n<li>MemorySSA-based MemCpyOpt is not enabled by default yet. We can test it under a flag, but due to current pipeline positioning it will have a compile-time cost.</li>\n<li>LLVM has switched to the new pass manager by default just after the LLVM 12 cut. This means that we should probably make a serious effort towards making the switch as well, as upstream now only does minimal testing of the legacy pass manager. The new pass manager tends to be a bit faster but use more memory.</li>\n</ul>",

This will fix <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28728\">#28728</a>.</li>\n<li>Known <code>noalias</code> related miscompiles have been fixed by the introduction of <code>@llvm.experimental.noalias.scope.decl</code> intrinsics. There might be more issues lurking here, but at least the previous blocker is resolved now. This will fix <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54878\">#54878</a>.</li>\n<li>Incorrect nowrap flags in LSR have been fixed. This will fix <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74498\">#74498</a>.</li>\n<li>fptoui.sat/fptosi.sat intrinsics for saturating float to int conversions have landed. However currently only X86 has optimized codegen. We may switch to these sometime in the future.</li>\n<li>MemorySSA-based MemCpyOpt is not enabled by default yet. We can test it under a flag, but due to current pipeline positioning it will have a compile-time cost.</li>\n<li>LLVM has switched to the new pass manager by default just after the LLVM 12 cut. This means that we should probably make a serious effort towards making the switch as well, as upstream now only does minimal testing of the legacy pass manager.</li>\n<li>There's a PR to <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/81451\">upgrade to LLVM 12</a>. Nikita managed to resolve the issues that came up. There seem to be performance implications in this upgrade (see the task for timing runs).</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",
