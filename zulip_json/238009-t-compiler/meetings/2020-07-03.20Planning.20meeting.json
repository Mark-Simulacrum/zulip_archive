I won't be able to attend, I think, not sure about <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116083\">@pnkfelix</span>. We do have a <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ameeting-proposal+-label%3Ameeting-scheduled\">few pending proposals</a>. We could plausibly discuss a schedule another time, have one or two people just draw up a proposal, or just skip this cycle. Thought I'd raise the question.</p>",
