It was filed last Wednesday and I looked at last Thursday's meeting minutes and didn't see it mentioned. The minutes said there were no new MCPs, so I just want to make sure it didn't fall through the cracks.</p>",

I _think_ the MCP missed last week's meeting because it was opened less than a day before the meeting, so I assume it was my fault I didn't include the last changes (I prepare T-compiler's agenda), if so I apologize.<br>\nHowever the MCP was seconded by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"125250\">@Wesley Wiser</span> (T-compiler co-lead) so I'd say the MCP didn't miss a beat.</p>",
