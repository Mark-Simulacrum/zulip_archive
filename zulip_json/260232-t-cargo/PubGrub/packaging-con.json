We present a rewrite from scratch of a recent algorithm called PubGrub, as a Rust library aiming at great performances and flexibility for reuse. We will dive into its core mechanisms, its high-level usage, as well as the ideas enabling behavioral extensions such as optional dependencies, entirely in user space without changing the library API.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/4715/RX21_AkZAT65pGHGocsaszlg/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/4715/RX21_AkZAT65pGHGocsaszlg/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/4715/RX21_AkZAT65pGHGocsaszlg/image.png\"></a></div>",
