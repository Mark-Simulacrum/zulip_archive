(Does it make sense there?)</p>\n<p>Another strategy would be to flood PR sections with 1 commit each, doing 10 (hopefully) independent PRs.<br>\nEasy to review, impossible to squash without force pushing <code>dev</code>.<br>\nWould this be better or would it create an unnecessary noise?</p>\n<p>I would like to hear what kind of PRs you prefer to adjust my strategy for the future.</p>",
