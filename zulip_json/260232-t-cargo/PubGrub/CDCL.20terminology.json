It is clear that terms correspond to literals, but it's less clear what incompatibilities are. I would tend to say that they correspond to clauses, but clauses rather seems to be the opposite of incompatibilities. While a clause is a disjunction that should have at least one literal evaluated true, incompatibilities are conjunctions that must evaluate to false (have at least one literal that is false).</p>",
