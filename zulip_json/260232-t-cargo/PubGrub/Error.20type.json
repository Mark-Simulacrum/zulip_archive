It does mean that a users error type needs to be thread safe even if there code does not use it. But compatibility with <code>anyhow</code> would be a big improvement.</p>\n<p>Ideally we would make it a generic, as the only thing we do with it is get it from a <code>DependencyProvider</code> and hand it back to the user. I have tried it a few times, and it works. But it would require adding more complexity to <code>DependencyProvider</code> so I did not want to make a PR until after <a href=\"https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub/pull/108\">VersionSet</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub/pull/104\">Priority</a>.</p>",
