So if I understand well, there are two goals:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>catch shared usage of a type at different versions at dependency resolution instead of at compilation</li>\n<li>possibly enable more situations for private dependencies (they can basically be any version they want)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(1) would require a constraint preventing from having two different versions of a crate connected via a chain of public edges (dependencies) in the dependency graph. One remark IÂ have about this RFC is that it will also result in false positives. It could prevent a crate from compiling because in theory two versions of a public dependency are available, but in practice they are not used together.</p>\n<p>(2) I suppose this could even enable situations where we have \"a\" at version 1.1 and 1.2 in the solution if they are both private dependencies? or is that stretching the concept of private too far? because how does that play with a public \"p\" within the private \"a\". I'm not sure I've read in the RFC what is the situations for public deps of private deps.</p>",
