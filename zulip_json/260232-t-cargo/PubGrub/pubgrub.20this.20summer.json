I would not want to block potential contributions of other people that will instead have more free time this summer. So I think we should cut 0.2.1 now so that the release branch is in a nice state for people that might use it as a base for experiments on current limitations. We can leave PRs 94 and 95 for later. Maybe merge 92 (history &amp; memory unification) if you think it's worth it and you have some time to focus on reviewing that.</p>",

It would contain explanations for most on the issues discussed in the \"advanced_dependency_providers\" repo, as well as a detailed explanation of why handling pre-release versions is extra difficult. I feel like having all that explained as clearly as I can will improve our chances of finding a good solution to those limitations, either us or someone else.</p>",
