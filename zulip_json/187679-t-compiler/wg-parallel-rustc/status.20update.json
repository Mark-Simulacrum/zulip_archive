        "content": "<p>Hi all, I'm lwshang, recently joined the rust-lang org on Zulip. As suggested by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116009\">@nikomatsakis</span> , I come here to help organize the progress and \"push it over the finish line\". I read the posts, caught up all the conversation happened here since April 10th and looked through mentioned PRs. I believe I have got a good understanding on what's going on and what we want to achieve in the short future. Let me summarize my take-aways and please correct me if I have any mistakes.</p>\n<p>1. In short, we want to make the parallel rustc a default behavior on July 4 or so. Before that we need to go through two test phases and collect perf information during the process.<br>\n2. We have criterions for each phases. As long as the schedule move forward and the corresponding criterion is met, we should be able to move on to the next stage.<br>\nCurrently, almost all the tests about parallel rustc have been done by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116466\">@Zoxc</span> , which utilized the rustc-perf infrastructure. To push to the next stage, the opt-in phase, we must meet the criterion for it. The criterion was not stated explicitly in the post. But I can imply some necessary condition from the threshold for the actual experimental phase. We should guarantee that the comparison from rustc-perf shows no \"major regression\". </p>\n<p>The latest such comparison provided by Zoxc still shows some tests can't pass the threshold. So it seems we still need to improve the technique itself for now. Or maybe we have some improvement during past two weeks, then of course we can move on to the opt-in experimental phase.</p>\n<p>No matter the technique is ready or not, we should be able to prepare those tools/scripts that we want users to use during the phases. This is what we can start to address now and of course requiring some more discussion here to do it rightly and efficiently.</p>",
