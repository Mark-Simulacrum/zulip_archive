Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116010\">@Aaron Turon</span> <em>won't</em> be putting more time into this effort after all. I think we have one fundamental choice, presuming of course we still want to ship (and I do!):</p>\n<p>- we can try to complete the work of removing shared state <em>before</em>  we try to ship<br>\n- or we can try to start getting people experimenting and find bugs the \"ol' fashioned way\".</p>\n<p>Of course, the work of removing and refactoring shared state can continue in parallel (no pun intended).</p>\n<p>We have previously planned to land the changes so that we build a parallel compiler by default and then give people a period to opt-in to testing, a period to opt-out, and eventually make this the default. This is kind of \"second plan\".  I kind of feel like we should being the period of making this available for people to pay with it, and we can pursue documentation / refactorings simultaneously. If we find people are not reporting a lot of bugs, that will also give us a lot of increased confidence, obviously.</p>\n<p>The main downside is that we will suffer a (one-time) slowdown for sequential work, since we'll be shipping a parallel-enabled build by default. But IIRC we had kind of determined that this cost was pretty minimal before. </p>\n<p>Anyway, maybe the first question is -- what is the best way to discuss this and how do we make the overall decision? We already had a design meeting where the state was roughly similar, and it seemed like we approved the overall plan, though I feel like there was also a desire to document more of the design (which has not really happened). Maybe we should just run from that consensus?</p>\n<p>I've been talking to <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116266\">@Santiago Pastorino</span> about trying to do some of the \"organizational\" work involved here. I assume <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116466\">@Zoxc</span> will also be around to fix bugs that come up, and I think that probably we'd be able to also start to ramp up a small set of folks around that (e.g., <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116122\">@simulacrum</span>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116114\">@Paul Faria</span>). </p>\n<p>Anyway, I wanted to kick off these conversations.

We do recover that perf on crate graphs with ~2 threads (or more) but that still seems suboptimal. It's also unclear to me that we're ready from a pipelining etc perspective for rustc to consume more than 1 job token throughout the compilation -- I think that'd pretty much kill all of the benefits of pipelining due to starvation of tokens.</p>",
