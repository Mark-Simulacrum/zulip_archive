Essentially instead of fully replacing the jobserver, the jobserver crate when configuring a process with the file descriptors would create a new pipe for each process and spawn up a global, single, thread which epolls across all of the process file descriptors. I think in theory this should be easier to implement but am interested in hearing what <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116015\">@Alex Crichton</span> thinks.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-group-mention\" data-user-group-id=\"1117\">@WG-parallel-rustc</span> with the above in mind, I don't know if it makes sense for all of us to meet...</p>",
