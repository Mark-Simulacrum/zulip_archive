I presume you can't make the current slot (Thursday 11-12am US Eastern time)? Can you provide a few times/dates that would work for you?</p>\n<p>I don't personally think that meeting tomorrow would be very productive -- I would like to have an agenda in place at least a day ahead of time if we're going to meet -- so I'm going to cancel the google calendar event. FWIW, the time is also not really super ideal for me, and it may make sense to try to reschedule to something more people (ideally, incl. Zoxc) can make.</p>",
