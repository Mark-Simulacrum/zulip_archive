We plan to take a breadth-first approach, attempting to put each piece of shared state into a bucket:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Necessary state; needs auditing for invariants, atomicity and lock order, and documentation</li>\n<li>Unnecessary state; should be refactored away</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In each case there are subcategories (e.g., in several places fine-grained locks around individual fields were introduced, with unclear atomicity ramifications; in many cases these could be consolidated into a single, more coarse-grained lock).</p>\n<p>The goal of the meeting is to categorize as much of the state as we can, and hopefully get to a point where we can write up more detailed issues for what we want to do in most cases. Afterward, we can figure out how to divide up the next steps.</p>\n<p>The meeting will be held on Zoom and recorded.
