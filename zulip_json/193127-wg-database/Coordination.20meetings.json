And I think zulip is also a great place to have them.</p>\n<p>I made a doodle for times: <a href=\"https://dudle.inf.tu-dresden.de/Rust_database-wg_kickoff_meeting/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://dudle.inf.tu-dresden.de/Rust_database-wg_kickoff_meeting/\">https://dudle.inf.tu-dresden.de/Rust_database-wg_kickoff_meeting/</a> (all times in UTC!)</p>\n<p>From existing conversations I think a good starting agenda would be</p>\n<p>1. Database adapters team (writing sync/async database adapters and common APIs)<br>\n2. A minimal migrations toolkit (around <code>barrel</code>)<br>\n3. Roadmap for database testing tools<br>\nFeel free to post your own agenda wishes below</p>",
