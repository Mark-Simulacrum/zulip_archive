I guess I've got a number of questions...</p>\n<p>Are there plans to maintain it? Are there future plans for improvements? Are there issues with the API which would make building something to replace it a better option?</p>",

It's been a while <span aria-label=\"sweat smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f605\" role=\"img\" title=\"sweat smile\">:sweat_smile:</span> I indeed didn't really maintain barrel in 2020. I've recently merged some PRs and fixed some code. I don't know if I'll have the time and energy to get back to the project  but the goal _is_ to cut a release with the fixes and finally implement a few features in the test harness that will make the library much more dependable</p>",
