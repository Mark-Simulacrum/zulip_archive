That would mean, that moving a <code>Vec&lt;T, MyAlloc&gt;</code> would need to correct the internal pointer, which is not possible. You have to encapsule the lifetime yourself by <code>impl AllocRef for &amp;(mut) MyAllocator</code>, or pass the lifetime to the allocator directly. The former is prefered IMO.</p>",
