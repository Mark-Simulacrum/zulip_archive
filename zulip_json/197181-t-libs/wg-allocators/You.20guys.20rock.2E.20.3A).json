I've been following the issues and discussion both on GH and on Zulip (I unfortunately haven't had enough time to do anything like contribute still, boo), and it's apparent that everybody is trying hard to unpack this brave new world of type safety and custom allocator support. Let me just say thank you and that I'm super excited to see great APIs and docs come out of the work being done here!</p>",
