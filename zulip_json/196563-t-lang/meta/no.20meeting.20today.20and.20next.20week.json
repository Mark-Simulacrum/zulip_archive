I'm super busy today and traveling next week so I think it's best if we skip. (Also, I've almost got last week's video ready to post; I had to do some light editing.) I wouldn't mind having an \"async conversation\" though about the best steps forward, though. I've been pondering what we ought to create as \"deliverables\" and how to best structure conversation.</p>\n<p>(We could discuss here or perhaps on an internals thread?)</p>",
