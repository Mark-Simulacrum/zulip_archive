Opening up my evenings to do non-work things is probably a good decision. I don't want to stop participating in the async foundations WG, so instead I'm opting for (temporarily?) attending meetings less often.</p>\n<p>Hope that makes sense; thanks all and see you next week! <span aria-label=\"heart\" class=\"emoji emoji-2764\" role=\"img\" title=\"heart\">:heart:</span></p>",
