To do so, we start at either <code>--start</code> or <code>--end</code> or today/installed nightly (this seems like a really odd list, to be honest, and I suspect there's bugs here) and then search backwards from that date in increasing jumps depending on how far we've jumped so far.</p>\n<p>Overall this just is a complicated looking geometric(ish?) search.</p>\n<p>Once we have a baseline, we narrow the other end towards us with the \"binary\" search -- as with all binary searches, this is not going to work if the underlying function isn't sorted (in our case monotonic from baseline -&gt; regressed).</p>\n<p>The slight complication is that it looks like there's some custom code in the least_satisfying function that tries to skip over \"unknown\" results (e.g., if you land on a nightly that's just broken for other reasons).
