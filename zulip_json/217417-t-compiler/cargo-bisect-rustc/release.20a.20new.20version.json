I discussed moving most of the source that currently lives in <a href=\"http://main.rs\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://main.rs\">main.rs</a> into a library and adding unit/integration tests with Santiago last week.  He supports this and Mark indicated that he is <a href=\"#narrow/stream/217417-t-compiler.2Fcargo-bisect-rustc/topic/sharing.20knowledge/near/188215844\" title=\"#narrow/stream/217417-t-compiler.2Fcargo-bisect-rustc/topic/sharing.20knowledge/near/188215844\">deferring the review to Santiago due to other time commitments</a>.  </p>\n<p>The error handling PR is a first step in that direction.  It only refactors custom errors out of <a href=\"http://main.rs\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://main.rs\">main.rs</a> and doesn't address the testing issue. At the moment, the git functionality and the least_satisfying nightly/commit testing approach live outside of <a href=\"http://main.rs\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://main.rs\">main.rs</a>.  We can move everything else from the <code>run()</code> function up into a <a href=\"http://lib.rs\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://lib.rs\">lib.rs</a> at this stage or use a more modular approach, then begin the work on the tests.</p>",
