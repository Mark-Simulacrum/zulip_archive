It looks like this is sorted out and should be fixed as of his latest commit.  We are having a more general conversation about how to approach the reporting and it would be useful to hear from you what elements in the report are useful/required for your GH Actions based tool.  Separate issue, but please let us know if there is a way to better support your approach.  Perhaps something like an optional structured data format output approach that eliminates the progress reporting and only includes the test result data at the end of execution?</p>",
