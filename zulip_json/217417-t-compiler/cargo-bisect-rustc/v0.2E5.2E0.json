I opened a <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/86\">PR</a> last night to reformat the final report that is pushed to rust-lang/rust threads. This addresses a conversation that <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116122\">@simulacrum</span> and I had a couple of weeks ago.  The PR removes some of the Markdown formatting that users don't push into the threads and adds additional bisect-rustc data to identify the version that was used, the host triple, and the args to reproduce the bisection.  I suggest that we push a new release once that PR is reviewed and a decision is made about whether to merge it.  </p>\n<p>cc <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"133247\">@bjorn3</span></p>",
