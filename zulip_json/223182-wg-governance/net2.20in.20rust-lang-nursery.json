I asked Alex Crichton, but he says he is not maintaining it anymore.  Is it possible for Patrick Mooney (pfmooney on GH) and myself (jclulow on GH) to take over maintenance of this crate?  We would be happy to set up a new GitHub organisation and get CI/CD builds going, etc.</p>",

I'm really looking for a central place to address issues around crates in the nursery org in general, as the actual ownership seems somewhat distributed amongst the ~49 people in that org but I can't really see a central place to reach  whoever is in charge.
