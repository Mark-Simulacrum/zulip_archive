A quote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One challenge that exists in the .NET OSS ecosystem is that most successful libraries are developed by a single person as a hobby. While this often results in highly rated libraries (because they are labors of love) it creates a high risk for maintainer burnout and thus uncertainty for support and longevity. This is also reflected by the projects we see in the .NET Foundation as well as for members of the board -- virtually nobody has the luxury of being paid by a company to do this as part of their job.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sharing here because it talks a little about how the .NET Foundation assists the ecosystem.</p>",
