How do you feel about the process it took to get those changes accepted?<br>\n3) How do you feel your group benefits from being part of the Rust organisation?<br>\n4) Does your experience of forming a Domain Working Group change how you see the mission of Rust?<br>\n5)If relevant, how has your experience with Rustâ€™s Domain Working Groups compared to working in other language domain groups?</p>\n<p>Best regards,<br>\nVal Grimm, on behalf of the Rust Governance Committee</p>",
