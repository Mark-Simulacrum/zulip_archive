We are contacting you because you're a member of a legacy GitHub Team on rust-lang, and not a current member of any other team. We're trying to transition managing access and permissions to rust-lang/team. Eventually we intend to remove the legacy teams which could result in you losing write permissions on some repos in the rust-lang org. If you believe you still you need access please get in contact with us, by either replying to this email, or on Zulip.</p>\n<p>Zulip: <a href=\"#narrow/stream/223182-wg-governance\" title=\"#narrow/stream/223182-wg-governance\">https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/223182-wg-governance</a></p>\n<p>Thank you for your time,</p>\n<p>Erin (XAMPPRocky)</p>",
