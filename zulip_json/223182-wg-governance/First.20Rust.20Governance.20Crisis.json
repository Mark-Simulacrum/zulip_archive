(And, for anyone with more insight into what's actually happening, do you agree with MM's assessment, which may be somewhat hyperbolic, that this is a \"crisis\"?) It seems like any analysis of the problem needs to happen in private for now, since the details of what transpired are intentionally not public. So presumably Zulip is not the right forum for that. But we do at least constitute a set of people interested in helping develop more transparent and resilient governance structures and practices.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-group-mention\" data-user-group-id=\"2317\">@WG-governance</span></p>",
