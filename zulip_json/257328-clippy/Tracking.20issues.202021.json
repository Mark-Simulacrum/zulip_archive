You can find an overview on the GH projects page here: <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/projects/3\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/projects/3</a></p>\n<p>If you are interested in taking up one of those tracking issues, just assign yourself to the issue. We will talk about the remaining ones and the expectations in the next meeting: <time datetime=\"2021-01-26T16:00:00Z\">2021-01-26T17:00:00+01:00</time> </p>\n<p>I pre-filled the issues with some steps and the kanban board with some issues. Those are just my ideas. If you take up the issue feel free to delete everything in the Issue description and manage the task as you see fit. I just wanted to give some inspiration for those issue to give interested people a head start and some orientation.</p>",
