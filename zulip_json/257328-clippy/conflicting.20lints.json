To properly fix this, we would need some query in rustc <code>lint_triggered_for_span(LINT_NAME, span)</code>. This would probably live in diagnostics, so you may want to ask in the <code>t-compiler/wg-diagnostics</code> stream, if they think that this would be possible (or even does already exist).</p>",
