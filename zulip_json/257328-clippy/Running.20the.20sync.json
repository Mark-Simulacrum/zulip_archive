This is mainly because of the generated merge commit in rust-lang/rust. On those conflicts you can mostly use the Clippy changes. After resolving every conflict and before running <code>git commit</code> I always do a <code>cargo dev fmt</code> <code>cargo dev update_lints</code> <code>cargo test</code> (for dogfood) and include all necessary fixes in the merge commit. But overall those conflicts should be easy to resolve.</p>\n<p>To avoid having to wait on a nightly I always run <code>rustup check</code>, check out the commit of the latest nightly in rust-lang/rust and then sync from there.</p>",
