        "content": "<p>Good evening!</p>\n<p>While working on some nalgebra stuff, i was refactoring my code to use a type parameter for <code>Vector3&lt;f64&gt;</code>. I realized that a lot of the code i missed still has <code>Vector3&lt;f64&gt;</code> which is implied by <code>Vector3&lt;T = f64&gt;</code> in my type. Therefore i was thinking it could be useful to perhaps have a lint which warns against this kind of thing, where the usage of a type parameter on a type declaration is redundant because the passed type parameter is equal the default. e.g. </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">pub</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">type</span> <span class=\"nc\">Bar</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"n\">T</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kt\">u8</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nb\">Vec</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"n\">T</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"p\">;</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">pub</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">struct</span> <span class=\"nc\">Foo</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"n\">a</span>: <span class=\"nc\">Bar</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"kt\">u8</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"c1\">//   ^^^^^^^ warn: `Bar&lt;u8&gt;` is redundant as `Bar` defaults to `Bar&lt;u8&gt;`</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Any thoughts on this addition?</p>",
