While I was browsing the repo to learn the directory structure, I found that most lint rules are placed in <code>clippy_lints/src</code> but some are in <code>clippy_lints/src/methods</code>. And I also read \"Adding a new lint\" saying that <code>cargo dev new_lint</code> command creates a new rule file in <code>clippy_lints/src</code>. So I'm sort of confused... why are some rules in <code>clippy_lints/src/methods</code>? How do we decide where to put a new rule file?</p>",

This is often easier and you can also reuse the structure of the other lint.

Note that it's important to read some other lints and see how they are implemented. Imitate their setup for your new lint.</p>\n<p>Then I update <code>CHANGELOG.md</code> and <code>src/lib.rs</code>so that they are hooked to the correct module for the new lint (<a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/6646\">example PR here</a>).</p>\n<p>Finally, I write some tests and start checking if the new lint is hooked properly by running , for example,<code>TESTNAME=manual_flatten cargo uitest</code> and see if I get errors in the console.

The <code>methods/mod.rs</code> file (previously in <code>clippy_lints/src/methods.rs</code>) is still way too big wiht multiple thousands of lines. Same goes for <code>loops.rs</code> <code>types.rs</code> and <code>transmute.rs</code> (maybe also <code>misc.rs</code>, I'm not really sure what's in that file though). We _should_ refactor clippy to adopt the structure that <code>methods</code> _should_ use.

Even when you move lints around/deprecate/rename them. So no need to do this by hand. (Except you implement a new <code>LintPass</code> then you have to add a line to <code>lib.rs</code>)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Finally, I write some tests </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I always recommend doing this as a first step. It helps when writing the lint and it prevents you to just test what currently works. And you will have to write them anyway.</p>",
