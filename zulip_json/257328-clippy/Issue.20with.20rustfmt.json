In both cases, it did nothing: the version was the same before and after.<br>\nAfter running <code>rustup toolchain install nightly --profile=default</code> and waiting for the installation, I now get <code>rustfmt 1.4.34-nightly (ea268b9 2021-01-28)</code>, but I still get the same error when running the test.<br>\nI just checked <code>rustup toolchain list</code> and I saw this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu (default)\nnightly-2019-07-18-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\nnightly-2021-01-30-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\nnightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>So I removed all the nightly, and I ran <code>rustup toolchain install nightly</code>. It installed back <code>nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu</code>. When I ran <code>cargo test</code> again, it installed <code>nightly-2021-01-30-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu</code> and I eventually got the same error.<br>\nI also tried to install the two nightly toolchains in the reverse order and the funny thing is that after installing the 2021-01-30 one, <code>rustfmt +nightly --version</code> says <code>error: toolchain 'nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu' is not installed</code>.<br>\nIt's weird, it seems that is a confusion between the two nightly toolchains.<br>\nI also updated the repo to get Philipp's PR, but the stderr contains nothing. :-/</p>",
