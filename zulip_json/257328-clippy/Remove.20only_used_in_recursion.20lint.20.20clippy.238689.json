For my investigation see <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/8689#issuecomment-1096693028\">my comment</a> on the infinite recursion issue about this lint.</p>\n<p>Generally I think the lint is over engineered and tries to catch too many cases. To a point where the tests don't cover most of the code AFAICT. The code is therefore also really hard to read (=&gt; maintain) without a visible benefit (e.g. in a specific test case).</p>\n<p>My question now is: should we remove the lint and wait for a rewrite? Should we keep it in Clippy but don't run the lint pass for now, effectively disabling the lint? Or am I just too dumb to understand the linting code? <span aria-label=\"big smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f604\" role=\"img\" title=\"big smile\">:big_smile:</span></p>",
