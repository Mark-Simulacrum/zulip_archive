Related PR <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/5978\">clippy#5978</a>.</p>\n<p>I would prefer either giving the right suggestion or not linting this case, as I think Clippy should never suggest code that does not compile, but I think this is debatable and would like to have more opinions on it. </p>\n<p>For the record the relevant lint does <em>not</em> support automatic fixes.</p>",

        "content": "<p>In the PR you linked, I think the suggested solution is good: Noting that <code>'_</code> has to be inserted in some cases. (This could also be done with <code>span_lint_and_note</code>) Also putting such an example in the lint documentation is helpful.</p>\n<p>As long as the lint is not auto-applicable, we should provide good enough help messages, so that the code can be improved, without producing/relying on a compiler error afterwards.</p>\n<p>Not linting, just because we can't produce a perfect suggestion is not a good approach IMO.</p>",
