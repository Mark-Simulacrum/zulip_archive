The PR can be found here: <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/7361\">rust-clippy#7361</a>. I was only able to test it on linux so far, could someone with windows or macOS maybe checkout the branch and test the tool as well? That would be greatly appreciated! <span aria-label=\"upside down\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f643\" role=\"img\" title=\"upside down\">:upside_down:</span></p>",
