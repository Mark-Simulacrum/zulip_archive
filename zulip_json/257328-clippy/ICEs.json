Never dealt with that before, I was wondering how are you testing this on Clippy basecode?<br>\nDo we need to just add a test file in <code>ui/crashes/ice-xxxx.rs</code> and run <code>cargo test</code>? Or do we need to declare something else more specific?<br>\nI ask this because for example for <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/6251\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/6251</a>, I added a test file and I saw the same error Matthias encountered, then I read the message of Eduardo so I got confused.<br>\nI don't say you are wrong, maybe my test is totally broken <span aria-label=\"laughing\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f606\" role=\"img\" title=\"laughing\">:laughing:</span> , but then I was wondering what is the process for ICEs <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>",
