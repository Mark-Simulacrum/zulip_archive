I would apply those labels like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>P-low</strong>: Requires attention (fix/response/evaluation) by a team member but isn't urgent</li>\n<li><strong>P-medium</strong>: Should be addressed by a team member until the next sync</li>\n<li><strong>P-high</strong>: Should be immediately addressed and will require a out-of-cycle sync or a backport. This is for example an ICE in a popular crate, many other crates depend on.</li>\n<li><strong>P-sync-blocker</strong>: An issue that \"blocks\" a sync. Or rather: before the sync this should be addressed, e.g. by removing a lint again, so it doesn't hit beta/stable. I will scan for those issues before each sync.</li>\n</ul>",
