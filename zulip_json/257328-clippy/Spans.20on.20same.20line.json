I would like to check if two Spans are on the same line of code. I found a bit of a hacky way to do it by using <code>clippy_utils::line_span</code>, which gives me the span until the beginning of the line. I expand both spans this way and then compare boths <code>span.lo()</code> positions to check if both spans begin on the same position. Do maybe someone know if there's a nicer way to do it? And if not, should I add a utility method to clippy_utils/lib.rs?</p>",
