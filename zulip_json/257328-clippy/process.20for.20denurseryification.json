Lints that have been nurseryified should require wider review before publishing, perhaps even running on common crates and seeing where they error, but _at least_ requiring more team input (perhaps a zulip thread?)</p>\n<p>If a lint is born in the nursery i think it's okay to have a low bar to publish it to non-nursery without much additional process. Idk.</p>",

This might be a too low bar for quite new lints like <code>transmute_undefined_repr</code> though.</p>",
