It works nice except that we have to set <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> to the folder where the <code>librustc</code> shared library is. I noticed that <code>clippy</code> does not need to find this dynamic library all the time. Does it mean that it's statically linked to <code>librustc</code> ? I tried hard to look for clues in the <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/</a> <code>build.rs</code> or <code>Cargo.toml</code> but couldn't find anything unusual, so it looks like magic to me :)</p>",
