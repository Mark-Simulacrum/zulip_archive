This avoids 2 potential problems:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Clippy only builds because the right things are cached.</li>\n<li>CI fails because the wrong things are cached (and the only way to resolve this in GHA currently is to change the cache key with a version number or similar)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And building Clippy doesn't take that long. Usually 1-2min. I more open to cache build artifacts for the dev tools. But that will result in us not being able to share a target dir between clippy_dev and clippy.</p>",
