My editor is configured to format on save so that CI doesn't reject my changes immediately (which is annoying), but this means that changing anything in clippy results in diffs like this: <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/81405/files#diff-c71578f55dd58021b2557dd7d6e27dbb4c01d41a6390e0bf7e1cdbcf942dfcb4\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/81405/files#diff-c71578f55dd58021b2557dd7d6e27dbb4c01d41a6390e0bf7e1cdbcf942dfcb4</a></p>\n<p>I'm not quite sure a \"reformat the world\" commit would be helpful, as it would hide some of the blame on the files, but trying to cherry-pick my changes from a reformatted mess is a bother. Does anyone have suggestions on what I could/should do here?</p>",
