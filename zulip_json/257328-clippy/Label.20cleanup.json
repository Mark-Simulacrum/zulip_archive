        "content": "<p>Sorry to start yet another discussion on labels. But this has been floating in my mind since I started triaging.</p>\n<p>The current label schema is not very well structured IMO. <code>A-</code> generally represents lint categories. But I think it would be better for it to represent project Areas, similar to <code>rust</code>. I don't know what <code>L-</code> means. It has the lint categories...and smattering of other stuff. <code>rust</code> has <a href=\"https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/contributing.html#issue-triage\">documented</a> all their labels and the prefixes. We should do the same.</p>\n<p>I propose the following label schema. The prefixes are largely copied from <code>rust</code>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>A</code>rea of the project<br>\n    * <code>A-documentation</code> - Clippy documentation (not lints) or the upcoming Clippy book<br>\n    * <code>A-lint</code> - Anything about the actual lints (maybe omit this if it's too broad)<br>\n    * <code>A-infra</code> -  CI and whatnot<br>\n    * <code>A-website</code> - the Clippy website<br>\n    * <code>A-UI</code> - Clippy interface, using and configuring Clippy</li>\n<li><code>C</code>ategory of issue: <code>C-bug</code>, <code>C-enhancement</code>, <code>C-tracking-issue</code>, <code>C-question</code>, <code>C-interesting-project</code></li>\n<li><code>I</code>mportance of issue: <code>I-crash</code>, <code>I-false-positive</code>, <code>I-false-negative</code>, <code>I-suggestion-causes-error</code>, <code>I-sync-blocker</code></li>\n<li><code>L</code>int category: <code>L-complexity</code>, <code>L-correctness</code>, <code>L-guidelines</code>, <code>L-performance</code>, <code>L-restriction</code>, <code>L-style</code>, <code>L-tests</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the above outline, <code>A-UI</code> and <code>L-restriction</code> are new labels. The rest are renamed, existing labels. I also thought of using <code>K-</code> (Kind of lint) instead of <code>L-</code>, but <code>L-</code> seems more intuitive to me.</p>\n<p>Additionally...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rename <code>C-needs-discussion</code> to <code>S-needs-discussion</code> - it's a status, not a category</li>\n<li>Remove these:<ul>\n<li><code>A-suggestions</code> - seems redundant. Nearly all lints have suggestions. If a suggestion is wrong, it's a bug. Otherwise, these are enhancements.</li>\n<li><code>A-unnecessary</code>-  seems too granular, could be merged with <code>A-complexity</code></li>\n<li><code>A-musing</code> Not sure what this is. Amusing issues? Same as <code>C-interesting-project</code>? At least add a description.</li>\n<li><code>hacktoberfest</code> - do we need to keep this around all year? Redundant with <code>good-first-issue</code>?</li>\n<li><code>O-*</code> - probably copied from <code>rust</code> but almost never used</li>\n<li><code>rollup</code> - not used</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",
