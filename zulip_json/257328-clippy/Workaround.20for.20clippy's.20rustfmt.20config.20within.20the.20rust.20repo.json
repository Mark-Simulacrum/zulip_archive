Text editor format-on-save is probably configured to use the repo-wide config, 2021 edition etc. Somehow <code>cargo fmt</code> inside <code>src/tools/clippy</code> does nothing.</p>\n<p>A quick and dirty solution is to run <code>cargo fmt -p clippy_lints</code> and again for each other package you touch, and disable format-on-save. I struggled with this for a bit, hope that helps.</p>",
