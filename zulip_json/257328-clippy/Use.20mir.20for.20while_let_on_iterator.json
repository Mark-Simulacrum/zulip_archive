To summarize, I need to know if I can transform <code>while let Some(_) = iter.next()</code> into <code>for _ in iter</code> without causing a borrow-after-move error. So, can I use mir to see if <code>iter</code> is borrowed after the while let loop? I've been trolling the rustc API docs and I see a lot of things that look vaguely useful, mostly in the dataflow mod, but I don't know where to go from here.</p>",
