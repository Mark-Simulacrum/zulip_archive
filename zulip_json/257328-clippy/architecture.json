This is just a prototype at the moment and not used in production.</p>\n<p>Since in the last 2 weeks I talked with various people about custom lints / linters, I thought about if it were helpful to provide a linter template, that you can quickly set up with <code>cargo generate</code> (or similar). </p>\n<hr>\n<p>For your question on how Clippy works:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is <code>clippy-driver</code>, which uses the <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_driver/struct.RunCompiler.html\">RunCompiler</a> API of rustc_driver. Lints are registered with the <code>callbacks</code> field of this struct.</li>\n<li>Then there is <code>cargo-clippy</code>, which is just the cargo wrapper for the driver. This mostly just does additional argument handling for the part behind <code>--</code> in <code>cargo clippy -- &lt;here&gt;</code> and calls the <code>clippy-driver</code> programmatically</li>\n<li>How lints work is closely tied to the highly unstable API of rustc itself. You can think of it, that Clippy runs rustc and just uses the AST/HIR/MIR, that rustc produced. So for example to get the type of an expression, rustc analyses the crate and Clippy then asks rustc for the type with <code>cx.tcx.expr_ty(expr)</code>. (This is no 100% accurate, but a good mental model for it IMO)</li>\n<li>Clippy has many helper functions in <code>clippy_utils</code>. We don't want to publish <code>clippy_utils</code> on <a href=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a>, since this is just as unstable as rustc itself. But if more people write custom lint tools and want to see helper functions from <code>clippy_utils</code> uplifted into rustc, this is definitely something that can be done.</li>\n</ul>",

And probably more, that I don't think of, since I never wrote a custom linter from scratch.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p>How this could be addressed:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>This could be easily addressed by providing a template, where you then just have to fill in the linting code</li>\n<li>You could circumvent this by using <code>RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=1</code> and could use any toolchain you like. You would still be bound to one toolchain and updating to a new toolchain will be a PITA, because of 3.</li>\n<li>Making any compiler internals stable seems impossible to me.
