Do we want to add this, as those traits are not part of the standard library? I think it would be reasonable to support <code>futures::io::AsyncWrite</code> as <code>futures-rs</code> is an official rust-lang crate that's used often enough.</p>\n<p>Does anyone have any thoughts on the matter?</p>\n<p>(See <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/8179\">clippy#8179</a> for more context)</p>",

The Author also asked about the <code>AsyncWrite</code> trait of <code>tokio</code>, what are your thoughts on that? The lint logic would remain the same as only one additional path would be checked for this and tokio is also stable AFAIK</p>",
