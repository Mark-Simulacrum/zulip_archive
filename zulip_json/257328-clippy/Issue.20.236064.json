I started working on <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/6064\">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/6064</a> and stuck on it.<br>\nI read <code>rustc_typeck</code> to know how default numeric fallback is handled and found there is no way to know whether default numeric fallback occurs from outside. This means we can't know whether an Eq constraint between unsuffixed numeric type and i32 or f64 is inserted by default numeric fallback or by something else.<br>\nSo, it seems that we have to implement another pass to resolve an unsuffixed numeric value to see it's possible without default numeric fallback.  Is this right?</p>",
