I'm currently working <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/5234\">clippy#5234</a> which requires me to change an if block in multiple places. The function <code>multispan_sugg_with_applicability</code> seams to be for such suggestions, but I can't get them to work. Is there a simple way to find the reason for this? <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/blob/945a41ca2ddd4ba7ef789e9de220e064b04d0e6b/clippy_lints/src/copies.rs#L288-L301\">The place that emits the suggestion</a></p>\n<p>(flip1995 has already mentioned that I don't need to add an \"auto applicable suggestion\" for this lint but I at least would like to try ^^)</p>",
