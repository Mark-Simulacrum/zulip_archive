The above proposals for the parser seem to be about how to get a parser that generates each of the existing AST and CST structures, my (admittedly likely naive) question is, is it an option to try and find another structure that satisfies the criteria for both and adjust rustc/rust_analyzer to this structure? Obviously that means any changes to one have to be supported in the other too but given that rust grammar is (presumably) fairly stable now this maybe this is no bad thing and even a desired outcome of this.</p>\n<p>Just wondering if this is something that anyone has thought about, is this a no go before it even gets started because the CST (which I know nothing about) and AST are too different? It would mean a lot of thinking about what that correct structure would be of course and then a lot of work in rustc to make whatever this new thing is generate the HIR again, maybe that's just too much work and too complex for an existing thing.</p>\n<p>Also curious if any there are any more thoughts in general about this given that a bit of time has passed since this thread started.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>",
