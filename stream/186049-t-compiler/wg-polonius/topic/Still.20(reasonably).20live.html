<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I'd just like to say that I haven't given up on Polonius yet, and plan on making some arrangements to make sure I have a minimum of time to work on at least keeping up to date and doing <em>some</em> forward progress after some things currently in flight land, which will probably happen around February. I've been completely floored by various other stuff, including distance teaching and haven't had time or energy to work on much of anything beyond that.</p>

<p>Hello! This might be a good opportunity to introduce myself. I just joined this stream a few days ago after reading up more on Polonius following some StackOverflow post where it appeared. Since most of the activity around it seemed some time ago with little that was recent (also no current meeting in the calendar), I was somewhat unsure about the status of the project (which this post clears up a lot), but I've been looking for a fitting way to contribute to Rust for a little while, and I'd be very interested to have this way be through Polonius. </p>
<p>Would You say that with your current situation as You describe you could see this a way to move forward, or is it more like there are certain things _You_ need to get done and getting me up to speed would need additional time which you don't have at the moment? I have some experience with logic-based programming, though more academical than practical, but do have practical experience with Rust outside of rustc.</p>

<p>It's worth saying that I too have plans to get back involved but not until the new year for sure</p>

<p>I'd be pretty excited for polonius to get to more of a "rhythm" then, it's going to require I think some adjustment of my responsibilities to make time for that, but I wnat to do that</p>

<p>I will continue to cheerlead from the sidelines.</p>

<p>I myself haven't had much time outside of work for a while, even though I'd also be excited to get back to it. (I've managed to do a couple things to try and have something for Niko and Albin to look at when they're back -- looked at cfallin's work on deferred borrows; still tried to look for more ways to make progress on the "precision, scalability, speed: pick 1" front; still nothing much that's newsworthy unfortunately)</p>

<p>needless to mention, it's still important to me :)</p>
