<p>BTW, one thing we had talked about was adding the ability to organize the profile per <code>DefId</code> or source-code location as well, so that people could get an idea what part of their programs are forcing compilation to take a long time. This just came up when I was talking to <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="116609">@Frank McSherry</span>, so it popped in my mind again -- I know it's not on the MVP plans, but do we still have this down as a kind of "eventually" sort of item?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="116609">@Frank McSherry</span> may have some good ideas of what specifically they want, as well. I remember <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="116015">@Alex Crichton</span> also being interested.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="116015">@Alex Crichton</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="119235">@David Tolnay</span> asked me about this at All Hands. We should have some kind of place to track these longer term ideas. Right now we're blocked on standardizing the export format from <code>rustc</code>. After that happens, a lot of these tools could probably be developed rather independently. Which might be a good opportunity for new people wanting to contribute.</p>

<p>profiling per query key is definitely planned. Source-code locations I don't know...</p>

<p>I think per-key is roughly the same thing as source-code locations</p>
