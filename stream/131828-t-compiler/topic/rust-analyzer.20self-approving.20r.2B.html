<p>So, rust-analyzer is slowly moving forward with the transition into rust-lang plan and there is one question that came up in regards to our current review "policy". That is we currently self-approve and merge a lot of PRs unless we want some eyes to look over it specifically.<br>
Excerpt from our <a href="https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/tree/master/docs/dev#permissions">docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's ok to self-approve if you think you know what you are doing!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the question here is, is it fine for us to continue doing so after things have moved to the org? This is a rather important topic as a main part of why this workflow exists for us is that we don't have a lot of people working simultaneously on the project, so without this workflow development progress will quickly come to a halt for the project. So we would like to keep this after the move into the rust-lang org, but we deemed this to be a rather important thing to bring up as it deviates from the usual for the org.</p>
<p>I am unsure whether this is the right team to bother, if a different place fits feel free to move the topic :)</p>

<p>I'm not sure we have a rust-lang org wide policy. The compiler team in general requires a non-self review before merging but there are exceptions for some kinds of PRs like rollups, clippy and other tool updates, etc. However, since you're not working in rust-lang/rust (correct me if I'm wrong <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span>), I don't think the compiler team policy really applies to you.</p>

<p>Ye we won't be working in rust-lang/rust, thanks for clarifying <span aria-label="thumbs up" class="emoji emoji-1f44d" role="img" title="thumbs up">:thumbs_up:</span></p>
