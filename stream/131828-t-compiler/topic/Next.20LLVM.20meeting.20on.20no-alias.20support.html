<p>For anyone who might be interested in participating.</p>
<p>The LLVM-dev Mailing List is really taking the Alias Analysis seriously again, and a group has formed that's working on fixing the shortcomings in the current <code>noalias</code> optimization implementation (which is known to be unsound, and that's why Rust doesn't use it even though it is a super good fit for Rust's borrowing and ownership rules).</p>
<p>This work is open to the public and the group that has formed hosts a public reunion every four weeks. The next one will be on <strong>July the 14th</strong>.</p>
<p>I'm posting this here for if anyone wants to chip in / represent rustc's perspective / just learn from it. I don't think I can really give them much of my own harvest, but I might go to learn from it.</p>

<p>I hope this is useful to some of y'all <span aria-label="heart" class="emoji emoji-2764" role="img" title="heart">:heart:</span></p>
