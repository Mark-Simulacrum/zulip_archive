<p>Hello there libs team! I was just wondering if there is any interest in the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/72762"><code>narrowing_rem</code></a> issue that was created a while back. I'd be interested in creating a pull request for this if it's something that might be accepted. If there's opposition for whatever reason, I'd obviously prefer not to spend time on it <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>

<p>It's a good operation, but it's not obvious to me that it's best in <code>core</code> compared to being in <code>num</code> or similar -- with other useful things like <code>dev_ceil</code>.</p>

<p>(Notably, it needs a trait, and the bar for having a new trait is higher.)</p>

<p>I would love to have a way to be able to just add these as normal <code>Rem</code> implementations, but we can't do that these days because it has inference impact.  Maybe with chalk we'll be able to add some rules that will let us add them.</p>

<p>Yeah, having better inference for ambiguous traits would be awesome, though I understand it's a ways off.</p>
<p>Off chance the bar for adding a trait is any different if said trait were sealed? Presumably not, but you never know. Regardless, this is something that could definitely be done in <code>num</code>, and is probably worth a pull request there. For better or for worse, that's probably not something I'll do, as I don't personally use that crate for anything.</p>
