<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>There was some discussion in <a class="stream" data-stream-id="182449" href="/#narrow/stream/182449-t-compiler.2Fhelp">#t-compiler/help</a> about the possibility of adding regex support to libtest. See <a href="#narrow/stream/182449-t-compiler.2Fhelp/topic/Adding.20regex.20dependency.20in.20.60test.60/near/225425947">this</a> conversation and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/53278">the Github issue</a>. There was some discussion on whether or not this feature would be worth the complexity to add, so for this topic I would like to discuss the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do people think this feature is worth adding? It is clear there is interest when looking at the Github issue, but is it worth the extra complexity of adding <code>regex</code> to <code>libtest</code>?</li>
<li>If it's clear that the extra complexity is not worth it, would it be possible to add regex support to an external crate so that it's optional? I'm not really into how <code>libtest</code> is used internally, but I have some feeling that wouldn't be easy.</li>
</ol>
<p>If anyone has any other thoughts on the issue, I'd like to hear those as well!</p>
