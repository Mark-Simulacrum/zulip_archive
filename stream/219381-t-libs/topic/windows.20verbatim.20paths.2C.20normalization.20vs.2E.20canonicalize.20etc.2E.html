<p>The PR in particular appears wrong to me for two reasons a) it tries to add "do what I mean" behavior to fairly low-level operations (pushing/joining) b) it does so <em>only</em> for verbatim paths which are more a "do as I say" and not a "do what I mean" thing.</p>
<p>Dealing with verbatim paths is annoying of course. But I think it would be better to improve things so that their use can be avoided most of the time. E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>add a <code>normalize</code> function so that <code>canonicalize</code> can be avoided</li>
<li>teach cargo to add manifests which opt into long path aware behavior by default when building executables</li>

<p>For background, I'll try to provide a short(ish) summary.</p>
<p>Traditional "Windows" paths are like <code>C:\Windows\notepad.exe</code>. These paths support <code>.</code> and <code>..</code> lexically; that is they resolve them based only on parsing the path string and not by asking the filesystem to resolve them.</p>
<p>However, these Win32 paths are also a lie. Modern Windows is built on the NT kernel with the Win32 API as a subsystem on top. So the Win32 subsystem changes Win32 paths to NT paths. NT paths look like <code>\Device\HarddiskVolume1\Windows\notepad.exe</code>. They do not have any special support for <code>.</code> or <code>..</code> as these are just ordinary file names. And the kernel is "lazy". It will only resolve as much of the path as it has to, the rest it passes to whatever device will handle it. E.g. in <code>\Device\NamedPipe\name</code> the <code>name</code> part can include any nonsense like <code>\\\</code> and it's up to the <code>NamedPipe</code> device how it handles that.</p>
<p>This detour into NT paths should just be an implementation detail. Except it's not. To avoid some of the limitations of the old Win32 paths (which are kept for backwards compatibility), there is a way to pass a path (almost) directly to and from the kernel through the Win32 APIs. This is done using the <code>\\?\</code> prefix. The Win32 compatibility layer will turn <code>\\?\</code> into <code>\??\</code> but otherwise leaves the path alone. This works because the NT <code>??</code> directory contains symlinks like <code>C:</code> which redirects to the right NT path.</p>
<p>This is great because it can be used to avoid the old <code>MAX_PATH</code> limit. But it's also bad because it skips all the other parsing and magic handling of <code>.</code> and <code>..</code> components, which NT may treat as normal file names.</p>

<p>Also from that PR</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So these NT paths are essentially impossible to handle sensibly with Rust's Path/PathBuf without special knowledge of the device being used. Maybe the device uses $ as the path separator? In that case push is already broken. Maybe . is a filename? In that case components is broken. Etc, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think <code>Components</code> already does the right thing. It special-cases verbatim paths and doesn't treat <code>/</code> as separator in them, only <code>\</code>. And it doesn't skip over <code>..</code> or <code>.</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And it doesn't skip over <code>..</code> or <code>.</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Huh, you're right. I was relying on the docs for <code>.</code> behaviour, although to be technically correct it should probably return <code>Normal(".")</code> instead of <code>CurDir</code>. But still, my wider point was that once a component is a device sub-path it can't know anything about how that path will then be parsed. Say there's a device called <code>Foo</code> that interprets <code>$</code> as a path separator. Then it would have paths like  <code>\Device\Foo\This$is$a$path</code>. Or maybe the device doesn't have path separators at all. It's just a single namespace. It's all outside of Rust's knowledge.</p>

<p>What if <code>\</code> isn't a separator for that sub-path? Operations like <code>push</code> and <code>components</code> are inherently claiming to know how to handle a path. With raw NT paths, all bets are off.</p>

<p>Yeah, I glossed over this a bit because I wrote that to explain Win32 paths. The NT object manager will treat paths that way. But I clarified in the PR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I didn't mention there is that the NT kernel does only the minimum to resolve the relevant device, the rest of the path it simply passes to that device to resolve. The device can do anything with that sub-path.</p>

<p>Yes. But I think you shouldn't be in a position where you're starting with <code>\\?\C:\</code> and then doing path manipulation on top of that in the first place.

<p>Yeah, it essentially wraps <code>fs::canonicalize</code> and converts the returned path. Which is what I think you're suggesting the std should do?

<p>My reasoning is that verbatim paths are too low-level access and there's no singular "do the right thing" for them. So instead of trying to make them ergonomic we should just fix all the reasons why someone might use them for normal stuff when they shouldn't be needed. The path length limit is one cause. Canonicalize another.</p>

<p>One possibility would be for us to add a new component type in paths, <code>VerbatimComponent</code>, that allows you to add unparsed arbitrary strings. That would allow for the <code>test\\\name</code> case and similar. Then, verbatim paths that we construct to avoid name length limitations could be treated as normal paths, while verbatim paths obtained from other places could be treated as unparsed.</p>

<p>My current thinking (but I'm not set on this and obviously others disagree) is that paths, by default, should be treated similar to Win32 paths because that's what's expected and wanted most of the time. And it makes it easier for non-Windows programmers to write cross-platform code without having to learn about any of this.</p>
<p>Treating paths as actually verbatim is the special case. Some people may want to do special stuff with <code>\\\</code> or whatever. They should be assumed to know what they're doing and Rust can help them do that. But I'm not sure it should be the default way of interacting with the path APIs even if a verbatim path is provided. There should be other functions for doing other kinds of operations.</p>
<p>This is possible because the <code>Path</code> type itself is just a container that passes on its contents. It doesn't do anything to the path unless the user explicitly invokes an operation. And those operations are both documented and intended to be cross-platform so that (for example) Mac programmers don't need to learn about Windows paths before compiling for Windows. And ideally they shouldn't have to learn to use <code>normalize</code> before calling a <code>fs</code> function just "because Windows".</p>

<p>But <code>push</code> already makes some assumptions. It will completely discard the path if an absolute path is given. E.g. pushing <code>C:</code> to a verbatim path results in <code>C:</code>. And <code>\</code> at the start of a path being pushed has special behaviour too.</p>
<p>IMHO, this is not about guessing what the user meant. This is about asking the user to be explicitly about what they mean. If they mean it to be treated as a "filesystem-like" path then use <code>push</code>. If they want to it to be an "anything goes" path then use <code>push_verbatim</code>. So the operations on the path define the kind of path. There isn't enough information in the <code>\\?\</code> alone for Rust to guess intent so it shouldn't even try.</p>

<p>So if I understand you correctly, you are proposing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep <code>push</code> as-is</li>
<li>Introduce new function <code>push_verbatim</code> which does special handling (i.e. remove <code>..</code> and <code>.</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>This makes sense except for one the use of the word "verbatim". When handling verbatim paths:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>push</code> adds paths mostly verbatim, i.e. verbatim as in dictionary definition, word-for-word/literally</li>
<li><code>push_verbatim</code> adds to verbatim paths, as in windows concept of verbatim paths, not verbatim as word-for-word/literally</li>
</ul>
<p>Also what does <code>push_verbatim</code> do on non-verbatim paths?</p>
<p>This sounds confusing.</p>

<p>This is an interesting question. I don't think you can add a file/folder with NUL / . / .. on a regular win32 path. Could it return an error? Or just add it "verbatim" to the path string and assume the user knows what they're doing. The other option is converting the path to a \\??\ path I guess</p>

<p>Thank you everyone for a good discussion. It looks like the PR is merged. I'll test it some more once it hits nightly.</p>
<p>I've been trying to think of any other pieces we need for verbatim paths. I can't think of anything.</p>
<p>PS I think rust <code>std::path::Path</code> is powerful enough to handle VMS paths: <a href="https://wiki.vmssoftware.com/Directory">https://wiki.vmssoftware.com/Directory</a></p>

<p>I am aware of these issues but not knowledgeable. Thank you for the good discussion! I think I am convinced that this is a positive change.</p>
<p>But, I am <em>very surprised</em> about the process here! Given this is a subtle change to windows behavior I would have expected knowledgeable parties to be cc'ed, like <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="120518">@Eric Huss</span> or @retep998 maybe @kennykerr or @rylev.</p>
<p>Given that this is a (invisible to crater) breaking change to a stable API I would expect some team to need to do a FCP. And for there to be a discussion of how we are going to let people know about the breaking change.</p>
