<p>Are we allowed to use SIMD functions (from core::arch) to optimize functions in <code>libcore</code>? Assume it's behind a <code>#[cfg(target_feature="sse2")]</code> check or similar, as I know runtime feature checking isn't available to libcore.</p>
<p>SSE/SSE2 is the only ISA I'd consider here because <em>I think</em> it available for the distributed builds of libcore on x86_64, and anything higher would require something like <code>-Zbuild-std</code> + <code>-Ctarget-cpu=native</code>...  I think?  But maybe this is wrong, because of things like <code>-Ctarget-feature=-sse2</code>...</p>
<p>I couldn't find any cases where we do it now, which makes me think it's not allowed, but I'd like to know for sure.</p>

<p>I recently reviewed every issue regarding SIMD in the compiler (indeed, every issue about SIMD opened against rust-lang/rust). Some reviews for vectorized implementations of various things have been done in the past but did not yield apparent performance improvements over the current in the explicit SIMD versions, which has somewhat dampened enthusiasm for the idea.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="209168">@Thom Chiovoloni</span> I think it'd be perfectly fine to do so, with a few caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>There may be x86_64 targets where it <em>isn't</em> allowed, such as embedded/kernel targets. It has to be possible to prevent it.</li>
<li>It'd be nice to avoid unexpected overheads from calling CPUID.</li>
<li>It'd be nice to make it possible to build several versions of functions and choose at runtime at a higher level. For instance, we could build multiple copies of libstd (when distros build it as a shared library) and install them to different directories, which the dynamic linker can decide between at library load time based on CPU capabilities.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, of course. Open to suggestions:</p>
<p>Naively, my thought is (and this is only hard because <code>#[cfg(test)]</code> isn't available I think, so let me know if I'm wrong about that or if there's another obvious option):</p>
<p>Expose the scalar/fallback impl under a perma-unstable <code>#[feature(core_private_simd_fallback)]</code>. Tests would exercise both this impl, and whichever impl we're shipping.</p>
<p>The big downside here is that we still would include this code in non-testing scenarios, despite it being dead code outside test scenarios. Maybe this is fine, or maybe it can be avoided by having x.py pass a special <code>--cfg</code> during tests and such? (Or maybe this already exists? Again I'm assuming <code>#[cfg(test)]</code> doesn't work becasue these are integration tests and not unit tests)...</p>
<p>That said, for a lot of cases, the fallback impl might still get used for inputs that are too small for the vectorized impl, so perhaps it wouldn't be dead code, and we could punt on this...</p>
<p>Alternatively, maybe the fact that CI is (presumably) run on both machines with and without support (I'd rather have it be easier to run the tests on both impls locally, so I don't like this, but it's the easiest option).</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="239881">@Josh Triplett</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="281757">@Jubilee</span>: Honestly I'm just asking about static dispatch, e.g. <code>#[cfg(target_feature = "sse2")]</code>, which <em>should</em> compile completely away for builds without that feature. That is: no cpuid call would be done/needed. This keeps things simple, easy to test, and is a big win in practice.</p>
<p>Concerns about cases like the kernel were why I asked this though, but I assume they already would have to build a custom libcore to avoid these instructions being generated by LLVM? (Since from checking it looks like the stdlib that gets distributed via rustup for x86_64 platforms is compiled with that target feature on and is already using these instructions in many cases).</p>

<p>Obviously this would come with benchmarks, and the win would also have to be significant enough to justify the additional harder-to-maintain code. (And it also can't regress stuff like small inputs).</p>
<p>There are several places where I'd like to do this (and it looks like I'll have a bunch of free time soon, and have recently learned how to test libcore without having to do a build of the compiler <span aria-label="sweat smile" class="emoji emoji-1f605" role="img" title="sweat smile">:sweat_smile:</span>). Anyway, the most obvious case to me is string and byte-slice processing, since it's such a big win to avoid per-byte work (you can see this in the fact that there are SWAR impls of some of these already, some of which I've contributed).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="125270">@scottmcm</span> Are there any particular ones which would be a problem?</p>
<p>In general this would be several intrinsics used to optimize a function that operates on a input slice multiple elements at a time. (In practice this is really the only way to get good SIMD perf IME), and so it's hard to come up with the exact set I'd need without just writing the code.</p>
<p>Anyway the time I most often feel the pain is when I call a function on &amp;str which does per-byte processing, so the <code>_mm_*_ep[iu]8</code> functions, but definitely others too.</p>
<p>If it helps, I don't really have any plans that would use the float operations, since libstd barely has any functions that use floats. Uh... <em>maybe</em> PartialEq/PartialOrd specializations for e.g. <code>[f32]</code>? But that's assuming it doesn't autovectorize into something half decent already (and it absolutely might).</p>

<p>Floats often autovectorize. And float vectorization is actually kind of almost dangerous because it appears to have wildly different results than scalar code (NaNs do different things and subnormal numbers...), I would actually say not to introduce float vectorization to the compiler yet without some thorough test suites that demonstrate it's not going to mess up anything.</p>

<p>Ah, this issue. Yes, it's a potential problem. However, that's a problem with <code>#[target_feature(enable = "foo")]</code>.</p>
<p>If you're <em>only</em> using <code>#[cfg(target_feature = "foo")]</code> to include code or not (eg: on a block), then you can't hit that particular issue. All functions in the build will exist with the same cpu feature set, so you can't get ABI incompatibility problems.</p>

(This should be up as a PR tomororw, it's done but needs more thorough testing, and I'd like to verify that it performs ok on things other than x86_64). It was pretty easy for me to copypaste it the SWAR code, and rewrite it to be a SSE2 version.</p>
<p>Here are the benchmarks for the old version, my SWARized version, and an SSE2 version: <a href="https://gist.github.com/thomcc/7bd1d22dfe3d31c1c4cc0de7771729aa">https://gist.github.com/thomcc/7bd1d22dfe3d31c1c4cc0de7771729aa</a> . You'll note that the SSE2 impl is around 10x faster (or more) of the old impl, and 2x faster than the SWAR version. This is actually <em>less</em> of an improvement than you'd normally get, because LLVM actually autovectorizes the naive Chars::count (see <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/5bvd7s">https://godbolt.org/z/5bvd7s</a>)! (Also I spent 0 time tuning it)</p>
<p>\* (Aside: Of course, Chars::count() is probably not a function worth having both a SWAR and a SSE2 impl of is worth it, since it's often an antipattern to care about the number of codepoints (I know I'm going to have to make a case for why it's worth even maintaining a SWARed version), and between SWAR and SSE2, the SWAR works everywhere so it's more important. This is not the point here)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Floats often autovectorize. And float vectorization is actually kind of almost dangerous because it appears to have wildly different results than scalar code (NaNs do different things and subnormal numbers...), I would actually say not to introduce float vectorization to the compiler yet without some thorough test suites that demonstrate it's not going to mess up anything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, I said I don't have real plans to do anything with floats, but... float FUD is a pet peeve of mine, and this is not accurate. Pretty much all float operations on x86_64 use the vector registers, and this is in part because it's actually a compliant impl of ieee754, unlike the x87 stack. (And it's faster).</p>
<p>(Also autovectorization is usually pretty bad and extremely fragile in practice. It also kicks in more for integers IME than floats... That said, again, the stdlib doesn't really have much float code that I can think of where this would be worthwhile)</p>

<p>I'll admit that does clarify many things I was a bit confused about.<br>
So the other thing about floats is that LLVM's  float implementation is probably busted, so it's hard to take advantage of IEEE754 compliance if we're just hoping on LLVM not getting in the architecture's way. ( though I imagine it's possible the way it is busted doesn't matter for the implementations you're thinking of. ) (and we're probably not any more or less busted + / - an explicit SIMD implementation of anything? probably. )</p>

<p>However, if libstd starts to use SSE2, it'd be rgeat if we could not break Miri. :) Something like what hasbrown does works, where <code>cfg(miri)</code> is a signal to opt-out of the vectorized implementation.</p>

<p>(Const-eval for floats seems off topic yes, but if you're in dire need of people who have floating point intuition/opinions/experience, I can take a look at issues (I certainly have the "opinions" part, anyway). I probably should now that I have some spare time, since I'd like floats to continue working well. That said, it's been a while since I did nontrivial numerical work, and probably have to page it all back in)</p>
<p>That said, there's probably some discussion eventually to be had about the fact that most of these sorts of optimizations aren't possible when performing constant evaluation, which could force us to choose between a fast impl and a <code>const fn</code> impl... E.g. marking a function as const fn prevents us from ever adding a vectorized version... That said, for now that's okay.</p>
<p>Re: keeping miri working, I use it almost every day so hope I wouldn't forget and break it, but I was going to just going to copy hashbrown's cfg expression verbatim, since it already works.</p>

<p>plans have been aired several times (if only I remember where...) to have a way for a <code>const fn</code> to provide a "const-time fallback implementation". it's hard, in particular to figure out what the exact contract for that function is, but not impossible.<br>
