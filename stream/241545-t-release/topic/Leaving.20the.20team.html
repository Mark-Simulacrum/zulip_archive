<p>Hi all, I thought it might be rude to post this PR without saying something here: <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/team/pull/441">https://github.com/rust-lang/team/pull/441</a></p>
<p>I wish I could have been a bit more helpful than I was, but I'm glad I was able to contribute as much as I did. I'm not leaving the Rust project or anything like that (I'm still part of wg-governance and am still leading project-ffi-unwind), I just don't think it makes sense for me to have the various permissions that come with official membership in this team.</p>

<p>can relate to that feeling but personally i think it's fine to have a few extra members on the team, you never know when it's useful <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span> Anyway, thanks for all the help <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>
