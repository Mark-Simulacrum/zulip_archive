<p>We're landing another increase in <code>mem::uninitialized</code> UB checking this cycle (1.48) -- see <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77970#issuecomment-713403218">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77970#issuecomment-713403218</a> for some context -- and I am hoping that we can publish a post on inside rust with both some context around these changes (i.e., code is UB, why it's UB), steps to fixing it (should be cargo update for most people, or a switch to MaybeUninit), and then ideally land and backport a change that updates the asserts to point to that post.</p>
<p>cc <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="307537">@Camelid</span>, you might have interest in writing such a post<br>
cc <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="120791">@RalfJ</span> as well, though I suspect you don't have time to write it up</p>

<p>I don't know too much about <code>mem::unitialized</code>/<code>MaybeUninit</code>, so I may not be the right person to write the post, but I'll try to look into it tomorrow :)</p>

<p>Thank you for suggesting it though!</p>

<p>I am happy to give feedback on such a post but I don't know when I'd have time to write one. But it's still a few weeks until the release so I could try to make some time until then.</p>

<p>also see <a href="https://gankra.github.io/blah/initialize-me-maybe/">this old post on <code>MaybeUninit</code></a></p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="116122">@simulacrum</span> so what is the timeline here, and what would be the focus of that post? <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="307537">@Camelid</span> did you have some time to look into it? (It doesn't look great for me to find that time; even when I have some time for writing, there are two blog posts I have planned to write for many months now that I'd like to finally get to.)<br>
I think <a href="https://gankra.github.io/blah/initialize-me-maybe/">https://gankra.github.io/blah/initialize-me-maybe/</a> already covers the "switch from mem::uninit to MaybeUninit" part and why it is important. So would this new post be mostly about the fact that we now have more checks and what can happen due to these panics (e.g., destructors running unexpectedly which can lead to double-panics or segfaults)?</p>

<p>I think it's probably fine to leave this unwritten for now. I might try to include a piece in main 1.48 blog (maybe somewhat more general, like "increased mitigations for some ub") or draft something for inside rust myself, though the latter I'm doubtful I can find time for.</p>

<p>But yeah, I had forgotten about that post, that's a good thing to point at and then explain just a bit more about current progress</p>

<p>Yeah, I think I felt that I'm new enough to this stuff that it might be hard to write a good post about it.</p>
<p>Side note: Before I got obsessed with Rust, I mostly used Python – not exactly low-level stuff!</p>
