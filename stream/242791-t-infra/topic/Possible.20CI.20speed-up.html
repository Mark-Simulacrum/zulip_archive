<p>Does the CI (on linux &amp; macos) set the niceness of cargo processes? I'm curious if aliasing the <code>cargo</code> command to <code>nice -n -20 cargo</code> would speed up CI builds.</p>

<p>What would you expect it to compete with? Nothing else should be running in our VMs really. I would guess that this would have very minor effects regardless, personally, but if someone wanted to try to add support and run some try builds to collect data I'm not entirely opposed.</p>

<p>The kernel might be doing background work, but outcompeting that could make things worse if it's actually background work we need to happen.<br>
A different thing that can be tweaked besides niceness is increathe timeslice length, e.g. by scheduling it as <code>SCHED_BATCH</code>. But improvements from that tend to be miniscule unless you have an oversubscribed CPU, which we shouldn't have due to the jobserver.<br>
CI is also really noisy since it's cloud machines, sub-percent improvements get drowned in the noise.</p>
<p>Imo the only thing that could really help CI is improving core utilization by the way bootstrap executes tasks.</p>

<p>macOS does not really run on cloud machines, it's on actual mac minis somewhere</p>
