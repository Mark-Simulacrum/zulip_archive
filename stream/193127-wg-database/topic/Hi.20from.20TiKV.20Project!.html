<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I'm Ana (Hoverbear) from the TiKV Project! You can ask me you'd like to connect with our team about our distributed transactional key-value store that's in Rust. We're part of the CNCF. We tend to focus on ultra-large scale systems (eg injesting 13 TB/day) and we have some expertise in the area. Currently some of our big problems are dealing with compile time bloat and working with some of our FFI bindings. </p>
<p>We publish crates like grpc-rs, raft-rs, fail-rs, and rust-prometheus. If you'd like to get involved directly with our projects, or use them in your own, we'd love to help you out. </p>
<p>Otherwise, I'll try to keep an eye on this channel and make any connections or comments that I feel I can! We think Rust is the best language for our project and we want to help. :)</p>
