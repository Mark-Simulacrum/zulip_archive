<p>I think it's really worth defining the intentions of the code reading club more, and comparing it to a lecture about code. I think a lot of people are expecting a "Crust of Rust" experience that goes through specific topics, but as far as I know, the code reading club's goal is completely different.</p>

<p>When I was part of the other reading club, I felt like I was very interactive, and I wouldn't have gained anything from a recording of it, since they aren't doing the activities themselves.</p>

<p>Sure, but then should the meeting have been posted in something like This Week in Rust? I think the moment that happened, "expectations" changed, and would have to change? It doesn't feel great to join in, and then be told by those who have done it elsewhere: "oh, it's actually an exclusive club" (which is what it feels like, when someone insists it's meant to be small and interactive: who gets to choose the participants then?)...rather unwelcoming</p>

<p>if there's a format between "Crust of Rust" and "usual reading club", then that's what a rustc code reading club might want to aim for, at least until the number of attendees reaches a steady state (which is likely &lt;&lt; 100)</p>

<p>Large part of why I joined is that I downloaded the rustc source, set everything up, and rust-analyzer really didn't like the project, ./x.py was panicking if I looked at it the wrong way, etc etc. So part of it is seeing the workflow of people who are experienced with rust development, since despite the depth of the rustc dev guide, there are still things missing. That would be covered by something like "Crust of Rust" for rustc, and would probably drive down most of the demand for this</p>
<p>Honestly, the whole 'reading club', I'd never heard of before - just found out about it through this and thought it sounded awesome, which made this sound even better.</p>

<p>It's not about the individual problems - I solved most of these, and fully intend to further debug the ones I didn't. It's about getting a workflow down - That feels like a very large part of the barrier to entry for rustc. Written instructions are one thing, but actually seeing it <code>feels</code> like another. Personally, I'm here for the reading club as much as I am for rustc, but I think that's a large part of the inflated expectations for this.</p>

<p>To add to <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="300743">@Sean Chen (he/him)</span>'s  comment: I think that given the amount of people interested here, it would really be a pity if such a reading club were to go unrecorded. Recording the presentation would have many advantages, and would only have one non-negligible drawback: deterring shy people from asking questions. I don't think that the latter can be as bad as gatekeeping, if only by the fact of being available exactly at the time of the reading, or even by other reasons should there be too many people interested, as seems to be the case.</p>
<p>Do note that deterring shy people from asking questions is not to be underestimated or dismissed —I'm not advocating for that at all!—, and so is definitely something that should at least be discussed / thought about. My personal idea here (besides the fact that a meeting with 100+ people live can be quite deterring as well), would be that the person(s) making the presentation (<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="116009">@nikomatsakis</span>?) record their screen &amp; their mics, but not the rest of the (meeting's) audio. Ideally, the people making the presentation / the reading would remember to repeat the question (but if they forget it wouldn't be that bad either: I'd rather miss an attendee's question on the recording than the whole recording altogether!).</p>
<p>On top of the "this info will remain available to future people interested on the topic or those unable to attend it", there is also another benefit for the meeting itself. I know that if it were to be recorded, for instance, I'd gladly not attend the live / real-time presentation, and from there it's fair to assume that some (how many?) other people would feel the same, which could relieve some of the logistical pressure of the meeting <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>
<p>And if any of you were to be willing to "repeat reading sessions", they could then have some of the following reading sessions go unrecorded, so as to not totally lose the unrecorded talk opportunity if it's deemed desirable or valuable enough.</p>
<p>If only, a poll regarding what others think on the subject could yield interesting results.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="232018">Daniel Henry-Mantilla</span> <a href="#narrow/stream/305296-rustc-reading-club/topic/Improving.20expectations/near/260661361">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To add to <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="300743">Sean Chen (he/him)</span>'s  comment: I think that given the amount of people interested here, it would really be a pity if such a reading club were to go unrecorded. Recording the presentation would have many advantages, and would only have one non-negligible drawback: deterring shy people from asking questions. I don't think that the latter can be as bad as gatekeeping, if only by the fact of being available exactly at the time of the reading, or even by other reasons should there be too many people interested, as seems to be the case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sean was referring to the stream of live rustc development that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="232545">@Joshua Nelson</span> offered to do which is a very different activity that code reading.  I'm very excited to see this too!  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do note that deterring shy people from asking questions is not to be underestimated or dismissed —I'm not advocating for that at all!—, and so is definitely something that should at least be discussed / thought about. My personal idea here (besides the fact that a meeting with 100+ people live can be quite deterring as well), would be that the person(s) making the presentation (<span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="116009">nikomatsakis</span>? EDIT: and <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="232545">Joshua Nelson</span> <span aria-label="raised hands" class="emoji emoji-1f64c" role="img" title="raised hands">:raised_hands:</span>) record their screen &amp; their mics, but not the rest of the (meeting's) audio. Ideally, the people making the presentation / the reading would remember to repeat the question (but if they forget it wouldn't be that bad either: I'd rather miss an attendee's question on the recording than the whole recording altogether.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Code reading doesn't involve Niko sharing his thoughts on the code or lecturing on the code.  It is a group of people (we agree that it's not possible to do with 100 people) sharing their personal and individual perceptions of the code.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>On top of the "this info will remain available to future people interested on the topic or those unable to attend it", there is also another benefit for the meeting itself. I know that if it were to be recorded, for instance, I'd gladly not attend the live / real-time presentation, and from there it's fair to assume that some (how many?) other people would feel the same, which could relieve some of the logistical pressure of the meeting <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Attendance in the next code reading club won't be wide open as it was for the first one mainly because it won't work for such a large number of people.  It will be helpful to hold a couple of these sessions so that it will be more clear to everyone, even those not reading our site, what rustc reading is and what it is not.  It's not a coherent presentation.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>And if any of you were to be willing to "repeat reading sessions", they could then have some of the following reading sessions go unrecorded, so as to not totally lose the unrecorded talk opportunity if it's deemed desirable or valuable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope that more people will come forward like <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="232545">@Joshua Nelson</span> has an offer other types of sessions that demystify rustc.  The popularity of the first Rustc Reading Club clearly demonstrates there is lots of interest.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If only, a poll regarding what others think on the subject could yield interesting results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Until there is better understanding of what the structure of Rustc Reading Club is and what it is not among the community, a poll won't help us.</p>

<p>I have a small change that needs to be made to a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/90358#pullrequestreview-796939299">PR</a> and I really wanted to do some sort of "stream" of it. Would this be helpful? I was thinking of starting from scratch ish</p>

<li>clone the repo</li>
<li>set up vscode</li>
<li>build (then actually switch to my current up-to-date copy already ready so I don';t have to build llvm and stuff)</li>
<li>explain a bit about the feature <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89554">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89554</a></li>
<li>make the changes and submit</li>

<p>Twitch can be set to record videos and the videos can later be exported to a linked YouTube account but note that Twitch <strong>does not</strong> record videos by default, you have to enable the recordings be saved before the stream goes live.</p>
<p>Youtube I believe does save recordings by default but to stream anything at all you have to use the "Go Live" page once and then request streaming access and then you'll be approved for streaming 24 hours later.</p>
