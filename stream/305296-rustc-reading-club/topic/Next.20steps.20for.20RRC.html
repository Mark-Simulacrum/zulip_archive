<p>This is true.  I was going to post about this soon.  Might as well do it now. :). </p>
<p>We've been experimenting with various flows to the sessions since October.  Our next meeting will include a retrospective by the members who have participated.  Then we plan to discuss next steps which will likely include recording future sessions.  I'll know more after we complete the retro.</p>
<p>Another general interest event is planned for our next RRC on Feb 3rd.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="116083">@pnkfelix</span> has graciously agreed to do a demo of Pernosco for the group.  He plans to record the demo and post it to his YouTube channel.  It will be available for everyone to watch and learn from.</p>
<p>I'll update here following the retrospective on Feb 3rd.  Stay tuned!</p>
