<p>So I was talking to the person who runs <a href="http://readrust.net" target="_blank" title="http://readrust.net">readrust.net</a> on discord. I feel like we need better visibility for the summaries and activities of the various compiler working groups. I was envisioning that it would be nice to have a central blog that just contains these sorts of updates and announcements -- basically, the <strong>activity</strong> of each of the working groups. In fact, I suspect that the blog should be <strong>project wide</strong>, with the ability to filter by team, by working group, or by other things. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://readrust.net" target="_blank" title="http://readrust.net">readrust.net</a> author encouraged me to write-up an issue with more details. Before doing that, I thought I would open up some discussion here.</p>
<p>I've also been wondering about the structure of the weekly meetings -- I was thinking that maybe, instead of <strong>pulling</strong> from the groups, each group should <strong>push</strong> updates, content, and questions, and we can review them in the triage meeting. </p>
<p>Originally, I had in mind that we would go round robin because I thought it'd be useful to be able to see if working groups haven't been active with updates in a while. But we can do that separately just by having the updates organized by working group and checking for working groups that haven't posted any comments in a while (or, honestly, just monitoring Zulip). This could be a signal to go check-in and see how things are going and if we can do anything to help.</p>
<p>I'd also maybe like to cc some more folks to get more input, but I'll just start with posting a comment here I think. =)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="116010">@Aaron Turon</span> and I were chatting a bit more just now. We had a few thoughts. First off, that a key step in any successful WG is going to be forming a <strong>roadmap</strong>. I mean something semi-specific by this: basically, identifying "subprojects" of the working group (some WG may have just one) and figuring out, for each subproject, the next few steps. This roadmap can ideally be mapped out, but often will be "unrolled" just in time.</p>
<p>It's perhaps a good idea to think about some kind of "sprint-like" structure, aligned perhaps to Rust's 6 week cycle. Basically, every 6 weeks we have a "sprint meeting" where we try to plan out the next 6 weeks of work, and then in between we try to <strong>execute</strong>. </p>
<p>I think this sort of happened on NLL but not in an <strong>organized</strong> fashion. One thing I like about this is that, if you are going to e.g. spend a few days writing mentoring isntructions etc, it gives you a natural time to plan to do that (during the sprint planning week).</p>
<p>In between sprint meetings, you are mostly going to have 'smaller' updates.</p>
<p>I could see this aligning with the compiler meeting, particularly if sprint meetings are generally staggered. i.e., sprints are a great time to report up to the wider team (and community) what you are planning to do. There could also be room for smaller updates during a sprint but it's less important.</p>

<p>I think that a roadmap is definitely a good idea, something to get working groups working towards a goal could be helpful in keeping them active and attracting contributors to rally around that goal. </p>
<p>A sprint-like structure could work well. I'm wary of imposing too much structure but if working group leads are fine with it then I think it could work well.</p>

<p>So I was talking to <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="116266">@Santiago Pastorino</span> just now and I want to repeat some of those comments here. In short, it's clear that as the set of WGs scale up, keeping up with Zulip will get more and more challenging. The good news is that we're doing more and we're producing more and more status reports. The bad news is that this heightens the importance of us thinking about how to distribute updates on what is going on without requiring everybody to read every Zulip msg</p>

<p>I'm happy for working groups to use whichever processes they find useful. I'm just cautious of being too prescriptive and getting caught up in the "we do this process" and that being something we then don't deviate from.

<p>at minimum, in the traits WG, we've been kind of loosely following this, but without the overarching "sprint" -- it feels like it'd be good if we had the "sprint timeframe" overlaying it</p>
