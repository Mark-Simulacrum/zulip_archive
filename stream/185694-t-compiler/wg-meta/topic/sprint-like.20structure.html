<p>What I wanted to say about sprints, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="116107">@davidtwco</span>, was that I also don't necessarily want to <strong>impose</strong> it, or be too strict about it, but I think it's probably something that will evolve semi-naturally, at least for longer-running groups. In particular, I think it's really useful to be able to stop, spend some time assessing where you are, writing mentoring instructions, putting up a public post announcing what's been happening, and calling for contribution, and that seems to fit a 'sprint-like' structure pretty well.</p>
<p>This is precisely what I had imagined the "compiler-team triage checkins" <strong>being</strong>, and maybe it should play that role, but maybe it's something that wants to be distinct. Not sure. I guess I feel like I'd like to <strong>try</strong> it in some working groups and see how we feel. :)</p>

<p>That all makes sense. I think if that sort of workflow naturally evolves then we can document and provide some guidance about what has worked for other working groups.</p>

<p>(OTOH if it is working, maybe imposing it lets us build it into our meeting strucure, which might be helpful, idk)</p>

<p>I've been thinking about this. I don't feel great about trying to have a fixed "sprint timeline" and so forth, but I think encouraging people to outline a roadmap with specific steps is a good idea, and I think it would be nice to kind of ensure that the roadmap is periodically updated. </p>
<p>To this end, I was wondering if an obvious step would be to make a ROADMAP.md file in each working-group directory that outlines the rough "phases" of the project and where things are.</p>
<p>I also think it's going to be something that potential contributors would like to look into.</p>
<p>(Before adding to the template, I would want to create these for some actual working groups)</p>
