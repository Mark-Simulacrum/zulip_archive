<p>A new proposal has been announced: <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/issues/77">MCP: Deref Patterns #77</a>. It will be announced at the next meeting to try and draw attention to it, but usually MCPs are not discussed during triage meetings. If you think this would benefit from discussion amongst the team, consider proposing a design meeting.</p>

<p>I with we still used the RFC process for major additions like this.<br>
It's good to have a public document at a predictable location describing the motivation, alternatives, etc in detail.<br>
Random hackmd's are not discoverable and will be lost quickly.</p>

<p>MCP also turns public discussion into an effectively internal one, because the RFC repo is the place to which people are subscribed, not zulip threads and random hackmd's.</p>

<p>I haven't seen a single example where MCP would be an improvement for the lang changes over the previously existing FCPs on PRs (for small stuff) and RFCs (for larger stuff).</p>

<p>I tend to agree this would need an RFC, but maybe the MCP is intended to check if (someone on) lang team has bandwidth for this?</p>

<p>I brought the MCP with a dual purpose. One is making sure that, yes, the lang team does have the time to address this before an RFC is produced, but also I would like to use the MCP to resolve the major questions on deref patterns before the RFC is brought. This would also serve to decide how much the first version of this RFC would seak to add, and how much would be reserved to later.</p>

<p>Accepting an MCP that <em>leads to</em> an eventual RFC is exactly how the Safe Transmute project has been working out.</p>

<p>Yeah, this is not a project that could go directly from MCP to implementation. I would fully expect this to be a project that collaboratively develops a full RFC.</p>

<p>I don't think we'd make that decision <em>in</em> the MCP, exactly. Rather, I think we'd make that decision by way of approving a charter.</p>

<p>The project group could work with the liaison and the lang team to write a charter, and the charter would define scopes of the problem to be addressed.</p>
