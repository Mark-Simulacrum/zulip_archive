<p>Sorry for spamming the stream. Cross-posting from discord<br>
Hey all. This is Arsh Sharma from India. I along with a few friends at my university have been conducting an open-source month event in our university. I am among the few people pushing for rust presence in my university and it would be really great to have someone from the rust community, and give a beginner friendly talk about the rust-lang ecosystem, the future/usecases and how can one contribute to it.</p>
