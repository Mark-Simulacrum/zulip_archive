<p>Hi all. Although I've been able to keep up with GH pings and  post a chain of dataflow PRs that I've had sitting around locally since forever, I haven't been able to devote much time to <code>rustc</code> this calendar year due to some other commitments. (Un)fortunately, I have some more free time starting this week, so I should be a bit more active around here.</p>
<p>I have a few open issues that I'm planning to pick up in the near-term (structural match checking for constants) and some that I'm planning to defer (<code>const_trait_impl</code>). Lemme know if there's something I've missed in the past few months.</p>
