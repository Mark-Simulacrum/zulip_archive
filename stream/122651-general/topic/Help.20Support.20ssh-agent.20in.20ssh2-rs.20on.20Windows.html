<p>Cargo and other official Rust programs currently do not support ssh-agent on Windows. The root cause of this is that libssh2 (the C library that backs ssh2-rs which is then used by Cargo, etc.) does not currently support the ssh-agent on Windows due to implementation differences between the Unix OpenSSH ssh-agent and the Windows OpenSSH ssh-agent. I have written up a <a href="https://github.com/libssh2/libssh2/pull/517">PR</a> adding support for the Windows ssh-agent, but due to unfamiliarity with Windows the maintainers don't want to merge it just yet.</p>
<p>This is where those of you reading this come in. The libssh2 maintainers would like it if more Windows devs/users could review my PR before they merge it. If you have knowledge of Windows programming in C I would appreciate if you could review my code and/or test it.</p>
<p>Personally, I tested my changes by modifying ssh2-rs to use my PR branch and then ran a couple of simple test programs using the modified ssh2-rs. I've also patched Cargo to use my locally modified ssh2-rs and tested it by using cargo in scenarios that would have failed before, namely when checking out git repo crates over ssh.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance to all those who review and test the changes.</p>

<p>It didn't quite feel right posting this under there as this isn't compiler related. I'm already stretching it a bit posting it in a Rust community, which I'm only doing because my end goal is to get everything updated so Cargo supports the Windows ssh-agent.</p>

<p>In that case asking on the community discord may help, it’s the most active place I believe</p>

<p>Putting it on the next TWIR might also help if nobody jumps in until then.</p>

<p>Putting it out in TWIR isn't a bad idea</p>
