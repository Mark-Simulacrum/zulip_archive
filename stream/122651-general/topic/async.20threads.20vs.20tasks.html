<p>A passing thought I had editing Stack Overflow questions — people <em>really</em> don't understand the distinction between tasks and threads when it comes to asynchronous code. Many people say something to the effect of "I want to do this in one thread and that in another thread", but it's rare for them to mean that, and they actually want tasks. </p>
<p>It's complicated by the fact that sometimes you <strong>do</strong> want a separate thread, plus the fact that the bigger executors support multiplexing tasks across threads.</p>

<p>Multithreading, concurrency and parallelism are not always taught well, if taught at all in universities/computer science related programs</p>

<p>So people discover them when needing them, which is very much not optimal for such a subject IMO</p>
