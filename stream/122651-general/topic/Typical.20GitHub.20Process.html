<p>When someone requests changes on my PR in github, and I push new commits that I believe address those concerns, am I expected to hit the "resolve conversation" button? I've been doing so in an attempt to indicate that I believe the concern to be addressed, but am now worrying that this may be a bit of a faux pas and it is actually expected that the person requesting the changes be allowed to make the decision of whether or not to mark as resolved</p>

<p>I've been doing both. Largely marking them myself for nits and other minutiae which has an obvious solution and I'm pretty sure I've resolved. I leave it unresolved and maybe add a comment if the topic is non-trivial for any reason.</p>

<p>I often review PRs later for context on stuff so I often leave things "unresolved" in the UI sense because I want to be able to see them... but only if they matter, so yeah, same. Nits I just close.</p>

<p>Likewise. If someone reports something highly subjective, and I haven't already had a comment exchange with them to ask if something would work, then I'll push something and ask them. But if something seems like a largely objective request and I've addressed it, I'll mark it resolved. It can always be <em>un</em>-resolved if they disagree.</p>

<p>I often just mark things as resolved as soon as I think are resolved, expecting that the reviewer will check things again and judge if more iterations are needed or if it's good to go</p>

<p>I resolve conversation if I feel I've addressed their concerns. They then re-review and can open additional comments if necessary</p>

<p>Imo it depends on multiple factors. How trivial is the feedback and fix? Is the diff outdated after refactoring? Was it the reviewer who made the comment?</p>

<p>In principle I agree with this, and similarly that issue submitters should confirm that a change fixes their issue. But in practice, it seems to scale better to go ahead and resolve things, <em>because</em> resolving something is trivially reversible.</p>
