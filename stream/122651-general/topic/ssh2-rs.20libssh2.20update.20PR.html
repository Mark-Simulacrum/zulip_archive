<p>I hate to ping people out of band, especially on an unrelated platform and especially when I know you folks are very busy, but I've gotten a tad annoyed.</p>
<p>I've had a PR open on ssh2-rs to update version of libssh2 used for nearly 4 months now without a single comment. The tests have also been waiting that entire time due to GitHub's policy that actions can't run an a first-time committer's PR.</p>
<p>I would greatly appreciate it if one of you fine folks could at the very least kick off the tests on PR <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/214">#214</a>.</p>

<p>Personally I don't really have time to maintain this library any more. I created it for Cargo's git2 dependency on libssh2 and I don't have much time to do much other than that. I can try to merge bug fixes when I get a chance but if all you're gonna do is continue to be annoyed at me for having other things to do in life then I'm not really gonna set aside time to try to get this merged. I'll talk with other cargo folks to see if they'd like to be interested in helping to maintain this library.</p>
