<p>Hello all, </p>
<p>I don't know if this is the right place for this, so please remove if not. I've used a feature from nightly (std::iter::zip), and was wondering where it was at in the process. So I found the issue: (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83574">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83574</a>) and it seems to have been merged in March.</p>
<p>This sort of confuses me since the rust forge book gives a roughly 6 week progression from nightly to beta, and then from beta to stable, which I thought meant that post-merge, a feature takes roughly 12 weeks to get to stable. It seems like I was mistaken, so my question is two-fold:<br>
1) What details am I missing from the process?<br>
2) What stage is the above feature, and what steps need to be done for it to become stable?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="451171">@Patrick Poitras</span> unfortunately "stable" has two meanings - 1. is the stable release channel, like 1.56 or 1.57, and 2. is "this feature can be used without a feature gate". So <code>zip</code> is only available on the stable release channel if you use a feature gate (and feature gates are a hard error unless you use nightly).</p>

<p>Ah I see! It's sort of already in the stable branch, but the feature gate requires the nightly release. That explains things.<br>
Thanks very much for the answer!</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="451171">@Patrick Poitras</span> Also, the progression for a feature typically involves some amount of gathering experience with it, which is separate from the timelines of releases; depending on the feature and its complexity, that can take a variable amount of time.</p>

<p>But in this case, the feature seems simple enough, and I don't see any reported issues with it, so I've kicked off the FCP.</p>
