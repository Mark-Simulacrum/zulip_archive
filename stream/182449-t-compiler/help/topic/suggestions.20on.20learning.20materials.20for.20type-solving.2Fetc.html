<p>I have been wanting to get into the type-solver (i think its also referred to as the trait engine) for a while, as well as the way that Region's work in rustc, but I feel totally lost. I feel in small chunks I can grasp some basic concepts, but as a whole, the terms and structure of the code have me quite lost, and they seem very abstracted from how the type system works in my head when I'm programming in rust</p>
<p>Are there any good resources (including textbooks) to get at least some familiarity with how real type solvers work? I never took a typing class in college, I have Types and Programming Languages, but im wondering if that is too theoretical</p>
