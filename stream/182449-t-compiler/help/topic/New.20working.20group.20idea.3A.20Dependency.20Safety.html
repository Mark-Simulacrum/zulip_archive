<p>Note: I'm proposing this group following this article: <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/compiler-team/procedures/form-new-working-group/">https://rust-lang.github.io/compiler-team/procedures/form-new-working-group/</a>. Hopefully it's ok to do it this way. Let me know otherwise.</p>
<p>I'm the creator of this somewhat popular post on r/rust: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/qduia7/how_can_we_make_sure_this_doesnt_happen_with/">https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/qduia7/how_can_we_make_sure_this_doesnt_happen_with/</a>, which is related to the latest package compromised on npm, 'ua-parser-js'. </p>
<p>I am concerned about Rust's safety regarding dependencies that may be added to your project, and many other Rust users are as well (see the thread I linked). It is clear that Rust puts emphasis on its dependency system by making it very simple to use in comparison to other languages, and by having a relatively small standard library (no rand/regex/networking/etc). This puts the Rust language in the same position as nodejs+npm, and it's only been safe for now because it's nowhere near as popular.</p>
<p>I think there should definitely be a group working on increasing the safety of dependencies from multiple points of view: <a href="http://crates.io">crates.io</a>, Cargo, proc macros, documentation, etc. There's tons of ideas in the thread I linked and surely some of them can be serve as the initial set of goals by giving them more thought and just brainstorming. I'm not particularly sure about the leads of the group, but since it's quite varied I'd assume we need at least someone expert in each of the fields I mentioned to have their insight. As to me, while I'd love to help but I don't think I have enough experience to be a member.</p>
