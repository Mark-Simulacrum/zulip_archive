<p>I might be missing something, but I don't see how that would increase the risk at beta backport time: both clippy having more lints in nightly, and some clippy tests only being executed in nightly won't have effects on the promotion from stable to beta nor backporting stuff to beta, as beta strictly accepts more code and runs more tests</p>

<p>even though, if we go with the "some clippy lints are only enabled on nightly" rule it'd be better if the tests were annotated with the clippy lint name in the attribute, so that the "nightly-only" could be removed from the test along with the lint being ungated</p>

<p>In the past, we had some lints which were on nightly for only two weeks until beta was branched off, in that time we got some feedback and false positive reports which couldn't be fixed in time. To improve this, we would like to restrict new lints to nightly for some time to get feedback and to ensure that only fully tested and discussed lints are stabilized. Additionally, it would be nice if only lint passes with stable lints would be registered to avoid some ICEs on stable. (This references ICEs in Clippy code or due to incorrect rustc API usage)</p>
<p>I had an idea how this could be done with a bunch of compile time checks and some fancy logic. That's why I asked if the targeted release channel is known at compile time. After a debate with other team members, getting your feedback and looking a bit into my idea, I think that it's not the best and correct solution. </p>
<p>Instead, I have proposed another solution which can use <code>Unstablefeatures</code> and doesn't use compile time checks. The new implementation would register the lint as usual but change the lint level based on the value of <code>Unstablefeatures</code> and only registering nightly lints in their lint group if <code>Unstablefeatures</code> are enabled. This would not prevent ICEs from the LintPass, but prevent lint emissions on stable as long as the user doesn't specifically change the lint level. As an added benefit, it's comparatively easy to implement. We can also test on all releases as long as we include a <code>#[warn]</code> attribute for the tested lint  :upside_down_face:</p>

<p>Can you say more about not being able to fix them in time? I'd expect a beta backport making the lint allow by default to be the typical solution to false positives, for example, and a complete removal if it causes ices - it's not clear to me that the unstable features bit is necessarily a good idea: generally behavior differences like that can be pretty annoying (e.g., if you're reproducing a bug report and want to pass some -Z flag on stable compilers, now that becomes painful if it breaks things in a dependency when RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP is set).</p>

<p>ICE Fixes for lints are typically parted back to beta, that is true. Setting a lint to allow by default has been a solution for lints with a high FP rate. However, often these are just fixed on master and then released with the next version. Back porting every  fix would be a lot of work and might introduce new bugs. Changing the lint level and group whenever we get a significant FP report still takes some work. The idea was to also reduce the need to back port for these cases. </p>

<p>This is true, having an environment value to disable/enable this behavior on stable/beta might help.</p>

<p>Adding a feature flag to enable nightly lints was also mentioned in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/8211">clippy#8211</a>. As a result, users using this would lock themselves into nightly. We get some helpful reports from people who usually use stable, but regularly run the nightly compiler and nightly Clippy on their code. Having a feature flag would make this less simple than it currently is.</p>

<p>The extra work current arises from Clippy being split into two repos. Back porting is documented in our repo, but in practice is typically done by just one member (Something we should work on. Yes). To be clear, this nightly restriction is intended for lints which we consider to be stable and ready to be released. Unstable and WIP lints are handled differently. It's correct that nightly users should ideally not get a worse experience, and that's not the plan. However, by the nature of accessing new lints they will be less tested than lints on stable, which have been on nightly and beta before.</p>

<p>Most of Clippy's issues are related to false positives. We have tools like a mini crater to run lints on several crates before merging them. Even with this, we miss some edge cases or just get feedback from users that lints should be reconsidered. Having an additional nightly stage would not remove these problems but can potentially improve the stability of lints on stable and that's the main idea behind this.</p>
