<p>Hi team! I'm Shreyas, a software engineer who has recently become really fascinated with rust after reading about it in the WASM world. </p>
<p>I'm in the process of building my first rustc as we speak and can't wait to start contributing. If anyone has any suggestions in terms of first issues they'd like to see worked on, I'm definitely up for suggestions! Look forward to contributing and working together!</p>
