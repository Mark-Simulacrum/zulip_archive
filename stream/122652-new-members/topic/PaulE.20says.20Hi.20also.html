<p>Hi everyone, I am just starting here. I finished my PhD last year and have been slowly getting up to speed with rust.  Its such a fun language that I thought that I would try and give something back by helping out here though I am also multitasking with job hunting. I am presently looking at <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/53934">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/53934</a> due to a post from <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="119031">@Esteban Küber</span>  on twitter. Its a bit of a jump into the deep end but that's the sort of thing that I like!!</p>
