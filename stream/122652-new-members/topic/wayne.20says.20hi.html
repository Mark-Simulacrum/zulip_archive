<p>howdy! oh wait, i mean hi! i've contributed once or twice to clippy a few years ago but then got busy with work and didn't have much time for Rust. i'm now at a point where i am considering taking a year off of work to exclusively focus on my Rust open source projects. i'm also considering pouring some of that work hiatus time into Rust contributions because i really love the language and would like to do what i can to push it forward.</p>
