<p>Hi all, this is lwshang. I'm a Quant (also known as financial engineering) based in NYC. I learned rust since early 2018. I'm not an expert in Rust programming but want to contribute to the community. Thanks to niko's post recently, I finally find this right place . <br>
I made some contributions to rust-lang on github by correct outdated links in those READMEs. And I'm working on a Rust binding for kdb+/q which is a proprietary column-based database/SQL software that is widely used in finance. Therefore, FFI is one of my recent interests. I'm exploring Rust to get some other topics to try.<br>
I've some experience to manage small group of people and I enjoy the feeling to gather the advantages of every one to accomplish some goals. So I would like to help organize meetings and other efforts to promote the development of Rust.<br>
Since I'm new here. Could you guys please guide me to the working-groups which want an organizer or just a contributor? Looking for your response!</p>

<p>One thing that comes to mind is <a class="stream" data-stream-id="187679" href="/#narrow/stream/187679-t-compiler.2Fwg-parallel-rustc">#t-compiler/wg-parallel-rustc</a> -- I've been meaning to put out a call for someone to help in pushing that over the finish line. <a href="https://gist.github.com/nikomatsakis/1847ddd89e6af8077441acbcbf97090e" target="_blank" title="https://gist.github.com/nikomatsakis/1847ddd89e6af8077441acbcbf97090e">There is a summary of the status here</a> -- it might not be a great fit for you, but maybe we can try to form a group of folks. I think what's needed is to <em>some</em> extent engineering (but <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="116466">@Zoxc</span> has a lot of that covered) and then a lot of "tracking the details"</p>

<p>I suspect we'd want to offer you a bit more support though, since some of that project is figuring out "when are things fast enough" etc, which is something that is probably more of a "team decision"</p>

<p>Hi Niko,  I've spent a few days here to watching your discussion. I've seen some inspiring progress in some of the working groups. Definitely, I want to help some other groups to catch up. Thanks for pointing out a particular topic that request for help. I'll start to look at the <a class="stream" data-stream-id="187679" href="/#narrow/stream/187679-t-compiler.2Fwg-parallel-rustc">#t-compiler/wg-parallel-rustc</a> and read the post.</p>

<p>Really I think it's not necessarily a "someone" that we need, but perhaps a few someones :)</p>

<p>it's not that it's necessarily that much work, it's just that work shared is more fun, and of course if those someones are people working in their spare time, more hands always helps</p>

<p>I'd like to help out! Is there something I can do?</p>
