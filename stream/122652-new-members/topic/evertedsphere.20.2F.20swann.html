<p>hi! i'm swann. my handle is <a href="https://github.com/evertedsphere">evertedsphere</a> in most places; my pronouns are he/him. nice to meet you all :)</p>
<p>i have a "haskell programmer interested in programming language theory" background. i've implemented some type systems in the past (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/evertedsphere/sound-and-complete">"Sound and Complete"</a>). expressive type systems are interesting, but i also care about performance a lot: together with my interest in learning how production PLs are developed, that's made me want to get started contributing to rustc (or chalk, ...) for a long time!</p>
<p>i should point out that i'm by no means a expert rust programmer — i mostly wrote simple rocket/sqlx code and never had to worry too much about lifetimes — and what parts i knew are a little ... rusty (i apologise) owing to not having much to do with the language. however, i'm confident that i can pick things up (or recall things i've forgotten) as i go, especially once i have something fun to work on (like a compiler!) that will motivate me to pick up the things i don't know.</p>
<p>my interests lie mostly in typechecking, optimisation passes, code generation, and the like (which i believe is the mid-to-back-end of a compiler). in addition to learning about those topics, another thing i'd love to learn is how people develop the intuition necessary to propose and validate changes to a large, complex typesystem that isn't formally specified or proven correct (unlike the small typesystems i've played around with in the past). <del>(of course, i simply want to steal all this knowledge for myself so i can build my own really cool language someday. don't tell anyone.)</del></p>
<p>so, hi everyone! i'm going through the rustc development guide, and i'm excited to get started contributing to rustc — where do i go from here?</p>

<p>If you have experience with type theory you will definitely be able to help with any of those projects :)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="232545">@Joshua Nelson</span> do you know how i could find a mentor/find someone here i could talk to to e.g. find issues to work on?</p>
