<p>Hello folks! <span aria-label="wave" class="emoji emoji-1f44b" role="img" title="wave">:wave:</span>  This is Pranav. I am a full stack web developer, but have always been interested by core technologies and languages. To pursue this interest further, I've decided to contribute to my favourite language :) . I hope to learn a lot from the experienced developers here as well. <br>
I've started reading the rustc-dev-guide, and although its very well-written. The whole Rust project seems overwhelming <span aria-label="sweat smile" class="emoji emoji-1f605" role="img" title="sweat smile">:sweat_smile:</span> . <br>
I plan to continue working on the guide for the next week or so. In the meantime, please let me know if there are some simple issues I can start picking up.<br>
Apart from the guide, are there any other tips or suggestions you guys have to get me onboarded and skilled enough to make my first contribution quickly?</p>
