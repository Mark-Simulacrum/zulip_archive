<p>Well Rust Conf did two things for me today.<br>
'<br>
1. Inspired me two take the compiler head on and finally contribute to this awesome project. Trial By Fire ! <br>
'<br>
2. It taught me that some nice people like Niko (thanks for inviting me) are always willing to help out and lend a hand to people who want to help but don't know where to start. <br>
'<br>
Aside from that if you guys have any needs then I will try to help as much as I can. Also, If theirs anything I need to improve before I can help in-certain areas please don't hesitate to tell me how I can improve and acquire those skills.</p>
