<p>At the meeting the subject of "how do we get people to implement things?" came up. Remember that This Week In Rust has a "Call for Participation" every single week. It's often for <a href="http://crates.io" target="_blank" title="http://crates.io">crates.io</a> crates, but there's no reason that rust language work can't also be posted there for more people to become aware of.</p>

<p>It's not just implementers, but also T-compiler reviewers</p>

<p>compiler implementers become compiler reviewers and the cycle continues :)</p>

<p>That is one great point.</p>
<p>Another is that we're at 5,000+ issues and 210 PRs, so I suspect there's a lot of work to be done just getting things to a place where it can be reviewed at all. And if reviewers are doing work writing instead of reviewing it slows down the overall pipeline.</p>
<p>So, <em>without letting code quality drop</em>, it's probably wise to try and get more people working on the compiler so that we have a situation of "too much written and waiting on review" instead of "too much not even written yet".</p>

<p>I'd definitely prefer to be waiting on review than waiting on implementation</p>

<p>because even if someone gives up waiting for a review, their code is still available for someone else to pick up later down the line</p>

<p>and I think we're fairly good at reviewing at the moment, especially small to medium PRs</p>

<p>I'm torn between two impulses, and I haven't figured out what I think yet.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I find our current <a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/07/10/aic-unbounded-queues-and-lang-design/" target="_blank" title="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/07/10/aic-unbounded-queues-and-lang-design/">"unbounded queues"</a> setup kind of stressful and overwhelming. It's hard to track what's going on. I think things kind of get lost in limbo. Sometimes a lot of work goes on into an RFC, but there is nobody to implement, and the design just sits, and I think that leads to downstream problems. I'd prefer -- especially for larger projects! -- that we tried not to take on something we don't intend to finish. I'd prefer if we had some notion of who is going to do implementation <em>and</em> review before we take on big things.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I see that the current setup is in some ways natural for an open-source organization. There are smaller changes that I think would just never happen if we drove things in an overly top-down way. And you have things like the <code>unwrap()</code> work that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="130111">@anp</span> is tackling now, where the initial design was done last year, and yeah it sat around, but now <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="130111">@anp</span> is doing it, and we're all very glad that this is getting done. If we'd been too much of a stickler around provisioning before-hand, maybe it'd be done already, but maybe we wouldn't even have an RFC.</p>
<p>So I don't quite know what to think yet.</p>

<p>I wonder if we could get some help, via This Week In Rust or similar, to get a comprehensive list of "accepted but not implemented RFCs", as well as of "implemented but not stabilized RFCs".</p>

<p>Maybe just create labels and assign them to the tracking issues?</p>
