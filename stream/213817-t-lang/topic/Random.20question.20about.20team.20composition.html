<p>Hi! I was idly thinking about the composition of rust teams, and it occurred to me that the lang team is relatively small as teams go. That sort of makes sense, given that the lang team covers a narrower set of decisions than many teams, and conversely the language tends to be very complex and require a lot of skill to think about. </p>
<p>But then I was looking at the teams repository, and it seems that in the last few years (as far as the history in the repository goes), the lang team has lost several members, but not added any. Unless I'm missing something. That's fairly unusual, as far as I know. Most teams seem to add new members from time to time.</p>
<p>I was curious if there was some reason for things being this way. Certainly y'all can't be drowning in qualified applicants, but I'd think some of the leads on lang initiatives might be, for instance?</p>

<p>I would very much like to grow the team, in fact. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="239881">@Josh Triplett</span> and I have been talking about sketching out a better process for that.</p>

<p>Absolutely. We have rough process sketches, but need to make them more concrete and then start using them.</p>

<p>Happy to review any proposed changes if you'd like.</p>
