<p>Hey <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="132920">@gnzlbg</span> -- I am merging <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/2396" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/2396">rfc#2396</a> and I had a question. Looking at the list of "Unresolved Questions", I would put those more in the category of "future work". In other words, they are not things that must be resolved prior to <strong>stabilization</strong>, but more like possible future directions. Do you object to me editing the RFC to update the headings?</p>
<p>Also, regarding implementation, do you think you could help to guide someone who wanted to implement this RFC, or are you insufficiently familiar with those parts of the compiler? (In other words, I know you'd be around/willing to help discuss interesting questions that arise in how things ought to work, but are you also able to guide someone in the implementation process itself?)</p>
<p>Finally, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="239881">@Josh Triplett</span>, how would you feel about being the designated "lang team liaison"? I'm semi-inventing some process here but I thought it'd be good to indicate on the tracking issue who the shepherds/liaisons are. This feature doesn't seem to merit a <strong>project group</strong> but I think the concept still applies.</p>

<p>There are a couple of reasons I wouldn't be able to be the liaison for that project, the biggest of which is that I don't think I can or should take on an additional project given the two I have in flight right now.</p>

<p>I just wanted to note that I strongly agree about pushing back on assigning too many things to one person and thank you for raising that <span aria-label="heart" class="emoji emoji-2764" role="img" title="heart">:heart:</span> :)</p>
<p>Reading over the RFC (<a href="http://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2396-target-feature-1.1.html" target="_blank" title="http://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2396-target-feature-1.1.html">http://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2396-target-feature-1.1.html</a>) it feels like there's not much actual language questions to be answered quite yet (and indeed it is fairly minimal to a first look). Maybe we can "get by" with the lang team liaison being someone like <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="116118">@Matthew Jasper</span> who may be a good fit for some of the impl work as well? They attend many lang team meetings today I think too.</p>

<p>That sounds good. </p>

<p>I think I can mentor. I have an idea about how to implement this, and I'm somwhat familiar with those parts of the compiler.</p>

<p>I've already reviewed it a bunch, but the more the merrier</p>
