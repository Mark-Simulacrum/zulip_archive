<p>So <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="116083">@pnkfelix</span>, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="119031">@Esteban Küber</span> or others--</p>
<p>I was talking to some folks recently about custom diagnostics, better Rust IDEs, etc and I got to think about "expert systems". I was thinking how, for the builtin diagnostics we have, if we wanted to expose them in a rich IDE setting where people can explore them, we would need more metadata ---</p>
<p>e.g., being able to identify for users <em>why</em> we are giving them this suggestion ("your type had these characteristics" etc) might be really interesting stuff.</p>
<p>But that is kind of the same stuff a custom diagnostics engine would want to provide.</p>
<p>It starts to feel a bit like "expert systems", and makes me wonder about how much work there is in that context also about resolving conflicting diagnoeses and presenting multiple possibilities.</p>

<p>Kind of just musings but I thought they were fun ones</p>

<p>whoa, that's a pretty wild analogy. I'll have to reflect on it more.</p>

<p>my thoughts on this have always leaned towards outputting the build system/dependency graph as a RDF graph, which has the properties i believe you want to have for diverse tooling attach their arbitrary metadata to a graph node.  For cargo, specifically i'd make it output json-ld and using <a href="https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld-rdf/">https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld-rdf/</a> that is about as short a synopsis of the idea as I can give, but perhaps too short, so if i need to elaborate on anything let me know.</p>
