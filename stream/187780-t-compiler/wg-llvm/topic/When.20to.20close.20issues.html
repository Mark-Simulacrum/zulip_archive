<p>With the reduction in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/91449">#91449</a> , I think I can say fairly confidently that this is an issue in LLVM. I've filed a bug report there, although I'm not sure if it can be fixed - is it worth keeping the rust issue open to track that, or should I close it with "whatever ends up happening in LLVM, there's nothing we can do here"?</p>

<p>Personally, I think that for something as micro as that I'd say it might as well just be closed on the rust side.  (Since you did such a good job of reducing!)  We'll pick it up once it's fixed and released, and I don't see anyone getting blocked my the lack of it.</p>
<p>I think it's only worth tracking it on the rust side if it's a bigger thing, like it's important to the alloc removal optimizations or important for getting autovectorization to work reliably with Rust's less-UB semantics or important for stabilizing std::simd or something.</p>

<p>That sounds good, I've closed it for now. If there's more developments in the future, its always possible to reopen then in any case.</p>

<p>Right.  Especially now that it's easy to follow the LLVM issue and thus for someone to re-open it on the rust side once the fix lands in LLVM.</p>
