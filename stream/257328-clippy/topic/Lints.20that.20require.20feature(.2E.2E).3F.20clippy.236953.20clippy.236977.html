<p>I stumbled on an overzealous clippy lint today that wants me to use or patterns everywhere. While I would love to do just that, I'm running the latest stable version 1.51 and or patterns aren't set to stabilize until 1.53. Now I'm pretty sure this is a bug (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/6953">#6953</a>), but I'm curious more generally about the policy regarding lints that require feature flags. Personally, I think that lints should never make suggestions that require adding feature flags (even on a nightly compiler) unless the user has already added the feature flag. But I can also see an argument for using lints to discover unknown parts of the language, and for nightly users that might mean discovering new feature flags hot off the presses.</p>

<p>(One reason not to draw conclusions from the compiler being a nightly is that a lot of people (most?) run clippy with a nightly even if they use stable for the actual build.)</p>

<p>I guess you are using nightly Clippy and stable rustc? We removed the check for the <code>or_patterns</code> feature a few days ago (in nightly only) because it is stable in 1.53.</p>
<p>Is there any reason, why you would run Clippy 1.53, but rustc 1.51?  We definitely appreciate that you are testing nightly Clippy for us and therefore help catch bugs early, but it is recommended to use the same Clippy version as rustc to gate on Clippy in CI. So, a setup which gates on stable Clippy, but also runs an allow-to-fail nightly Clippy to see the effects of new lints early / catch Clippy bugs is optimal.</p>
<p>Setting <code>msrv</code> is currently not possible for this lint. But we should add that to the lint.</p>

<p>Ah, I see, I didn't know that clippy tracked rustc in this way. As you say, I run nightly clippy and stable rustc (this used to be the only way to do things, but even now it's useful to get the latest lints). Is there a way to set the msrv to "latest stable"?</p>

<p>I'm probably confused about what tracks what, but it seems like clippy versions should be separate from rustc since most lints and lint changes apply to all rust versions, and I would hate to use a 12 week old clippy just so that I can track stable properly.</p>

<p>Clippy is shipped together with rustc. So it totally makes sense that Clippy tracks the rustc version. </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, but wouldn't we then have to backport everything to every version? There is a Clippy version (strictly tied to the rustc version) were a lint is added and it will be available from there on onwards. Just because a feature is added in Rust 1.98.0 it isn't magically available in Rust 1.0.0 either.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>That's the same as saying: "I would hate to use a 12 week old <strong>rustc</strong> just so that I can track stable." If you want to use nightly Clippy, you're more than welcome to do so, since you'll help us find bugs in Clippy. But as with all nightly releases you will have to live with the consequences (i.e. bugs, unstable stuff, ...).</p>

<p>I see, this makes sense. Is there a difference between nightly clippy 1.53 and stable clippy 1.53 (as in something that clippy itself can detect and do differently)? Or is it just that in a few weeks you will be changing the program itself to work on the stable channel. Because what I would like to do is configure nightly clippy to act like stable, without actually using an old version. Am I asking for <code>RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP</code>? I'm not sure.</p>

<p>stable Clippy 1.53 will be released with stable Rust 1.53 and there are no guarantees that features from nightly Clippy 1.53 will be in stable Clippy 1.53.  Nightly releases are inherently unstable with no guarantees. You can't magically make a nightly release behave like a stable release. <code>RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP</code> makes a stable release behave like a unstable nightly. This env var is inherently unstable and you should not use it ever.</p>
<p>If there is confusion what a nightly build is, I recommend reading the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_build">Wikipedia article</a> about it. It is really short.</p>

<p>It doesn't. When you compile your project with a compiler with version 1.53., the compiler assumes that your project is compatible with compiler version 1.53. Clippy is not much different from a compiler.</p>
