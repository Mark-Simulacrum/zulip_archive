<p>I am really happy with our process for starting lints in not-nursery when they start out (unless they have new problems) because it basically gets us nightly review, but I wonder if we should require larger review for denurseryification?</p>
<p>Basically, I suspect our attitude should be that lints can be published in non-nursery from the get-go without mcuh process, but such lints are understood to have potential problems and we should be more trigger happy about nurseryification if people report a lot of problems. Lints that have been nurseryified should require wider review before publishing, perhaps even running on common crates and seeing where they error, but _at least_ requiring more team input (perhaps a zulip thread?)</p>
<p>If a lint is born in the nursery i think it's okay to have a low bar to publish it to non-nursery without much additional process. Idk.</p>

<p>I think the process of de-nursifying lints is quite hard. Which is why I think/hope that <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/8435">clippy#8435</a> (nightly-only lints) will help us more with testing lints out in nightly and only enable them on stable, if we got some feedback from the community. </p>
<p>I think a good bar for de-nursifying lints is, that almost all open issues about the lint were resolved before. This might be a too low bar for quite new lints like <code>transmute_undefined_repr</code> though.</p>
