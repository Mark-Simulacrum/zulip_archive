<p>Hey all, for today's meeting (in 20 mins) I re-read my own blog post from last November. I noticed some things that were clear to me, might not have translated particularly well to the post. So I took a stab today at a second part to clear them up. </p>
<p>It's pretty close to the meeting time, so I don't expect anyone to read this. But perhaps this will clear up some questions folks might have had about the original, and it might be worth at least glancing over.</p>
