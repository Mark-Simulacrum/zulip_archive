<p>Hey all, I wrote an idea I had of how we could potentially use Niko's idea for "view types" to create safe pin projections - and the general challenges of creating safe pin projections in Rust. It's intentionally less researched than some of my other posts, but I figured the idea was interesting enough that it was worth writing down. Hope folks find it interesting!</p>

<p>Heh, I know it's kind of too late, but I, too, wish the pin-projection unsafety had been written the other way around: unsafe to <code>impl Unpin</code>, safe to pin-project (or even that one could have been unsafe as well, I don't really care).</p>
<div class="spoiler-block"><div class="spoiler-header">
<p>problems of non-unsafe Unpin</p>
</div><div class="spoiler-content" aria-hidden="true">
<p>Non-<code>unsafe</code> <code>Unpin</code> is a big thorny aspect for a sound and non-<code>unsafe</code> pin-projection API: <code>#[pin_project]</code>'s current desugaring <em>currently</em> gets away thanks to limitations in the coherence checker. Any time the coherence checker becomes smarter and thus more lenient, it's yet <strong>another chance for <code>#[pin_project]</code> to become unsound</strong>: it is the case if <code>Unpin</code> were marked <code>#[marker]</code> (which is why it won't), and it is almost the case with <code>with_negative_coherence</code> (another "bug"/quirk/accidental lack of leniency in there currently "saves the day". The whole thing sounds so backwards).</p>
</div></div>
<p>Regarding raising <code>Pin</code> to become a full-featured language construct (it currently is a <em>hybrid</em>), I agree as well: <code>pin</code> projections, stack pinning, <strong>implicit <code>Pin</code>-reborrowing</strong> could all be made more intuitive thanks to it.</p>
<ul>
<li>(The type would have to be a <code>&amp;'r pin mut Self</code> rather than just a <code>pin Self</code>, though, I think, since we could also have APIs requiring <code>&amp;'r pin Self</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Heh yeah, definitely. I guess right now we consider "pinning" to be difficult, and we as the WG are looking to remove it as much as we can from APIs (e.g.  async trait-based<code>AsyncIterator</code>, <code>AsyncRead</code>, <code>AsyncWrite</code>). But I actually wonder what the user-experience was like if pinning better fitted into the language? What other than async APIs does pinning enable? What are we trading losing by moving to <code>async</code>-based core traits?</p>
<p>I don't feel like we have satisfying answers to that yet. And I think it'd be worth working through that. At the minimum so we've covered all our bases. Though I suspect that actually some things which seem obvious today, might not be as obvious as we assume.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="232018">@Daniel Henry-Mantilla</span> oh yeah, <code>pin self</code> vs <code>pin mut self</code> makes sense!

<p>If it's borrowing it has a lifetime; although it can obviously be elided. I prefered to name it here so that we can see in which order the elems of the pinned reference would be laid out <span aria-label="upside down" class="emoji emoji-1f643" role="img" title="upside down">:upside_down:</span></p>
