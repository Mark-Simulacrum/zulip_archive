<p>I'm not quite sure how to respond to <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-async-foundations/issues/90">https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-async-foundations/issues/90</a>. I think there is possibly some interesting things that could come from this, but the issue itself doesn't seem super actionable. should we just ask the author to try to reformulate what they're saying in a story form?</p>

<p>i think this issue is observing there are some problems for which only the actor model is suitable.   i'm not personally familiar with the actor model, so it would help me a lot of this issue had some more concrete examples of the types of code that can't use async and need to use actors.  i didn't really understand what "network stack layer" means</p>
