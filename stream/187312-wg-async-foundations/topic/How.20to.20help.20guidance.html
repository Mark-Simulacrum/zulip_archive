<p>Hey <span class="user-group-mention" data-user-group-id="1172">@WG-async-foundations</span> - I just put up a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-async-foundations/pull/257">PR adding more how to help guidance</a>. The idea is to have a clear chain from the welcome page to the roadmap and any goals or initiatives there that are looking for help. One of the ideas I had was to add a <span aria-label="working on it" class="emoji emoji-1f6e0" role="img" title="working on it">:working_on_it:</span> emoji for each goal/initiative with area-specific how to help or getting started instructions available. I included a link for polish, but I'd love to include links for other areas as well.</p>
<p>So, if you have instructions for you area already, let me know and I'll be sure to add a link. If you don't have how to help instructions, it'd be great to add some!</p>
<p>I'm also open to feedback for better ways to organize this information if anyone has ideas.</p>
