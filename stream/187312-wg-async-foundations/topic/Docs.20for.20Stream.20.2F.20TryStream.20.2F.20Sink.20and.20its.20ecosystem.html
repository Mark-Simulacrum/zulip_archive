<p>Answering some questions about streams and async made me remember the confusion I had when learning to use them initially. Specifically, it's wasn't clear to me what the relationship between Stream, TryStream and their extension traits were. Especially when dealing with the different asynchronous runtimes, I was under the mistaken impression that I couldn't use mix them between async runtimes (this is aggravated by the fact that a lot of function signatures changes between tokio and futures, for example).</p>
<p>This looks like a good first doc contribution, and I was wondering where the best place would be to document this, there are some docs in the different async runtimes, but as a beginner it can be tedious to navigate between these when you don't know the relationship between the projects.</p>
<p>Maybe the async book would be a good starting point?</p>
