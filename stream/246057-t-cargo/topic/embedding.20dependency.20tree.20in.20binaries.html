<p>I've recently released the <code>auditable</code> crate, which embeds the dependency tree in the compiled Rust binary if the project is built with Cargo. The primary use case is cross-referencing compiled binaries against a security advisory database, but there are other uses as well. The code and more info can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/Shnatsel/rust-audit">https://github.com/Shnatsel/rust-audit</a><br>
The end goal is to uplift such a system into Cargo itself. An RFC draft to that effect is <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2801">here</a>).<br>
I have two questions related to that:</p>
<ol>
<li>It would be very valuable to get some real-world experience with the data format before stabilizing it. Are you aware of any companies using Rust+Cargo in production, and might be willing to trying out <code>auditable</code> and providing feedback?</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/47384">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/47384</a> is destroying the ergonomics and will likely block a proper implementation within Cargo. What can I do to get it resolved, assuming I don't have the expertise to fix it myself?</li>
</ol>
