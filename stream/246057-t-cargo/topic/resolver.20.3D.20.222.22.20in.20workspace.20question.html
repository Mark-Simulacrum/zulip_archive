<p>I just ran into an issue into my workspace at work where the Docker build for one of my crates containing several binaries was failing while the repo-wide CI was passing. Turns out that one of the binaries in that crate depends on a feature for one of its dependencies that it's apparently getting because it gets enabled in another crate. I then figured I'd try to enable resolver = "2" in the workspace because I understood it to solve this kind of issue (if not, perhaps, this exact issue). So what's the expected resolution behavior for binaries across crates in a workspace? Are they still unified somehow?</p>

<p>The behavior in a workspace was not changed, the features still depend on which packages are being built. Issue <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/4463">https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/4463</a> is tracking that.</p>
