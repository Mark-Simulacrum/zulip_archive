<p><span aria-label="wave" class="emoji emoji-1f44b" role="img" title="wave">:wave:</span> is there some trick for embedding cargo run's logic for determining which binary to execute given the current working directory? i went down the road of adding cargo as a dep and parsing the package and workspace, but can't figure out the right way to get from a Config and a Workspace and some CompileOptions to a vec of one or more paths. this is for a custom cargo-watch type thing. it would be great if i could get it from cargo metadata, but all i see in there is the target_directory, but that wouldn't figure out which binary to run if the working directory was a bin crate inside of a workspace that contained other bin crates</p>
