<p>Hi Cargo team! The 2021 annual survey is almost ready: <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/surveys/blob/main/surveys/2021-annual-survey/questions.md">https://github.com/rust-lang/surveys/blob/main/surveys/2021-annual-survey/questions.md</a> This year we have changed things a lot more from previous years than has been done in the past, so we'd really like people from the teams to give some feedback. Please take a look and either file issues or leave comments here. Further, if anyone from the cargo team could attend a video meeting with Ryan and I in the next week or so, that would be very useful. Please let me know if you're able to do that.</p>

<p>Hey Nick!  I'll try to scan over the survey (it is quite large).  I don't personally have anything to add, but I'm happy to attend a video chat.</p>
