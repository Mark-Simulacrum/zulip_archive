<p>So I was a bit confused when I tried using <a href="https://github.com/kbknapp/cargo-outdated"><code>cargo outdated</code></a> why the section of "How it works" says it creates a temporary project and runs <code>cargo update</code> there, doesn't cargo have a local index that it could just consult for update information and figure this out easily?<br>
So after spending like a day randomly digging through <code>cargo</code> (the library)'s API I ended up with this <a href="/user_uploads/4715/Rjzc855Mt1dqs_81JyJdlVWB/Screenshot-2021-12-09-at-13.31.08.png">Screenshot of me running it on a really old mostly abandoned project</a> </p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/4715/Rjzc855Mt1dqs_81JyJdlVWB/Screenshot-2021-12-09-at-13.31.08.png" title="Screenshot of me running it on a really old mostly abandoned project"><img src="/user_uploads/4715/Rjzc855Mt1dqs_81JyJdlVWB/Screenshot-2021-12-09-at-13.31.08.png"></a></div><p>This is just a really quick draft without much deep thought or anything of that sort, it's just 150 lines of code that uses <code>cargo</code> library to check the <a href="https://docs.rs/cargo/0.58.0/cargo/core/manifest/struct.Manifest.html"><code>Manifest</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/cargo/0.58.0/cargo/core/struct.Resolve.html"><code>Resolve</code></a> for dependencies and then checks the index for updates. (but it is already much faster than running <code>cargo outdated</code>)</p>
<p>I insisted on using cargo's internals instead of external libraries to keep this PR-able, but I am not sure what's the process here, I know there's a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/4309">cargo oudated issue</a> which have been a bit silent now. So do I keep working on this and then just PR it? What would a Minimum Viable Product of the feature be so that I work towards it? Or is it better for me to develop it out of band and then PR it wholesale later down the line?</p>
