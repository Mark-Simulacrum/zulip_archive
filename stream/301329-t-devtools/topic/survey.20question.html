<p>That looks useful to me.  Has it been asked in the past?</p>

<p>From the rustdoc perspective, the one issue I see is that people may think we're referring to invoking rustdoc on their own projects, and they won't think about their use of rustdoc when they read library (stdlib and other) docs.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="307537">@Noah Lev</span> good point, cc <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="224872">@rylev</span>  worth renaming the tool names if they differ from their invocations</p>

<p>Saying <code>cargo doc</code> in addition to rustdoc would help, but even then, I think we should mention something about API/autogenerated docs in general.</p>

<p>Not in this form. We previously asked about "What is your experience with other tools you use?" and then asked for a rating from "really like" to "really dislike" (with the option of don't use). <br>
I suppose there are three aspects we may want to capture:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is perceived quality level of the tool?</li>
<li>How much has the tool's quality changed over the past year?</li>
<li>How essential is the tool to people?</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe the first one can also be measured or answered through other means (e.g., bug reports, blog post analysis, etc.). The second can be answered with year over year analysis (which while difficult when changing questions is not impossible). The third is the most subjective and hardest to tell from other sources. It captures the level of relative importance that the tools have and can even easily differentiate between tools that are not popular but still essential to those who use them (e.g., I imagine miri might fall in this category).</p>

<p>Thanks for the details.  A confusion I have is that the blog posts that present the results of the survey don't show all of the results.  From my perspective, if the results of questions aren't published, then they aren't useful to the rust-lang contributors.  Have I been missing where the data is collected?  I've always been a bit confused about that.</p>

<p>No you've not been missing anything. This has been due to a lack of follow through after we publish the blog post. We explicitly hope to publish all aggregate data and share it with the Rust project teams (if not completely publicly).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>One way to address this could be to change the label to "rustdoc / cargo doc / online API docs" or something similar. (And might be better to avoid using <code>/</code>s since it could be misread as <code>(rustdoc/cargo) doc</code> and confuse respondents.)</p>
