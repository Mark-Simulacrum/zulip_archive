<p>opting for chat vs tagging the group in the issue lest folks not want to be auto subscribed, but want to make sure folks have seen <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/93628">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/93628</a>, not only because of the rustfmt angle but also because of the potential for broader tool impact</p>
<p>will likely be a topic i'll bring up at your next meeting anyway</p>

<p>ah, good to see, this probably affects clippy in a million lil ways</p>

<p>For Clippy, blocking stabilization because Clippy isn't ready is definitely not a real option. If that were the case we wouldn't have <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/labels/T-async-await">async-await</a> to this day.</p>
<p>For the <code>let_else</code> feature we already found and fixed a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/7912">two</a> <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/7637">bugs</a> in Clippy.</p>
<p>Though for Clippy it is useful if a features lives a bit longer in nightly, so bugs in lints because of new features don't get into stable. A recent example of this is the implicit named arguments feature, which broke our <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/8290"><code>useless_format</code></a> lint. This bug got into stable, but with 1.58.1 we were lucky and could backport the fix. I think this feature was for a too short of a time in <code>nightly</code>, so that no one was using it, who also hit the Clippy lint. </p>
<p>So blocking stabilization because of Clippy is not an option. But possibly waiting an addition nightly cycle might be useful in some cases.</p>

<p>You're saying implicit named arguments wasn't in nightly long enough?</p>

<p>Not long enough for Clippy to catch a bug in a lint. I think the feature existed for 2 or 3 nightly cycles before it was stabilized? I guess that should be enough in theory. But then the question is also when people started using it (in combination with Clippy).</p>

<p>AFAICT, it was in nightly for more than a year before it was stabilized.</p>

<p>I'd guess that, because it's a convenience feature, people just didn't use it unless they were already using nightly for some other reason.</p>

<p>(and even further than that, due to the need to add a feature gate to use it, probably almost never using it)</p>

<p>Yeah. Features that introduce semantically new capabilities get more testing, because people want them enough to use nightly and opt into them. Convenience features get briefly tested, if we're lucky, but often not committed/pushed until they hit stable.</p>

<p>Oh really? I only really noticed this feature when the 2021 edition was announced, which was only a few months before it got to stable. Maybe people just weren't aware that this feature existed and mentally connected it with the 2021 edition, like me.</p>
