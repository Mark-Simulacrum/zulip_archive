<p>I've been thinking about spacing lately. This article was really good: <a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/built-to-adapt/intro-to-the-8-point-grid-system-2">https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/built-to-adapt/intro-to-the-8-point-grid-system-2</a></p>
<p>It introduces the notion of aligning sizes and spacing to a consistent 8 point (pixel) grid.</p>
<p>This sentence in particular caught my eye:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is because reaching an aesthetically pleasing composition to the overall page is difficult to consistently create. I can use my design eye to nudge a few elements here or there but I can’t rely on a team of designers and developers to share my same vision. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think rustdoc has a lot of that - various developers at various times nudging elements, sometimes with feedback from reviewers, and usually with a focus on a very specific part of the page. Adopting an 8 point grid would be a nice way to add some consistency in a way that anyone who works on the project can readily build on. That doesn't mean everything has to be 100% grid aligned all the time. The article also describes "soft grids" and "hard grids" as ways to talk about how strictly you adhere to them.</p>
