<p>As far as I understand there won't be any regular meetings until the next sprint starts in the new year due to understandable reasons (foundation stuff, holidays and so on). Despite that, will there still be active development on Chalk in the meantime? <br>
So if one were to try to make their first contributions could they still get all the help/answers necessary or should they rather wait for the start of the new sprint to have better chances of getting these?</p>
<p>(On another rather unrelated note: while working through the Chalk book in greater detail it appeared to me that, despite its "proposal" status and simply missing chapters, the book seemed to be a bit inconsistent  in some regards. Thus, I'd like to know how much it is focused on keeping it up-to-date and consistent.)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="365822">@FireFighterDuck</span> There might or might not be a meeting next week. But yes, after that, not until the near year. But yes, I'll be around for questions and help basically the whole time still (except maybe Christmas itself). Some others may be around off and on.</p>

<p>As far as the Chalk book, we are definitely trying to keep it up to date and consistent. If you spot something wrong (and doesn't have the appropriate disclaimer like, e.g., the implied bounds chapter) feel free to file an issue (or a PR!)</p>
