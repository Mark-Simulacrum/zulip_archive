<p>Hey, I filed <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74456">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74456</a> a short while back after some discussion at <a href="#narrow/stream/182449-t-compiler.2Fhelp/topic/debugging.20rustc.20OOM">https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/182449-t-compiler.2Fhelp/topic/debugging.20rustc.20OOM</a>. I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to ask for further assistance but I'd like to find someone intimately familiar with the trait solver internals who might be able to point me toward methodology for investigating this issue, as there hasn't been any momentum on it recently. It's understandably not a priority for others given that I appear to be the only one to have encountered it but it's blocking my research and I would simply like some advice if possible such that I might continue investigating it independently and contribute my findings at such a point as I become able to determine the root cause of the issue.</p>
<p>My main question is something tangentially mentioned in the issue: how do I figure out what the obligations are that are occupying this data structure? How do I figure out what higher-level query is responsible for this (at a level more granular than the top-level info provided by -Zself-profile)? How do I determine whether the function is being called a few times with a large obligation set or many, many times with smaller sets of obligations? Are there any deduplication steps before this function is called?</p>
<p>The only way I currently have to investigate this issue is attempting to read meaning into the soup of <code>def_ids</code> output by <code>RUSTC_LOG</code> or maybe running the compiler itself in a debugger, but neither approach gets me what I need. I guess I could recompile the debugger with extra prints to export the obligations to a file, but even for my smaller reproductions the size of that vector is multiple <em>gigabytes</em>, so I'm not sure how feasible that is, and the iteration time would be absurdly long what with having to recompile rustc. How do people usually investigate things like this?</p>

<p>I'm not very familiar with the trait system code so I think the two main things that would be helpful are:</p>
<ol>
<li>What's the usual workflow for debugging issues with the trait system code?</li>
<li>How can we figure out why the obligation vector is so large (multiple gigabytes)?</li>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="125250">@Wesley Wiser</span>  at this point I <em>think</em> what's happening is that normalization generates a bunch of extra obligations. i'm getting output for example "with 885017 obligations" from here: <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/src/rustc_trait_selection/traits/project.rs.html#270">https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/src/rustc_trait_selection/traits/project.rs.html#270</a></p>
<p>presumably, after that happens the previously investigated source (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/7e11379f3b4c376fbb9a6c4d44f3286ccc28d149/src/librustc_trait_selection/traits/select/mod.rs#L2053">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/7e11379f3b4c376fbb9a6c4d44f3286ccc28d149/src/librustc_trait_selection/traits/select/mod.rs#L2053</a>) is executed in order to deduplicate the obligation vec. i've been messing around with RUSTC_LOG and have noticed that the actual process of generating those obligations is pretty quick but after each execution of normalize_with_depth_to the compiler takes longer and longer to process the next iteration, presumably due to time spent deduplicating (as I earlier ascertained that doing so is a substantial portion of the CPU time spent, in the other thread in <a class="stream" data-stream-id="182449" href="/#narrow/stream/182449-t-compiler.2Fhelp">#t-compiler/help</a>. it does seem like the amount of time spent deduplicating is nonlinear over the number of obligations generated, which doesn't make sense to me given that it's just inserting them all into a hashset, but I'm not sure. this output from projection is consistent with the most recent update from on the issue (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74456#issuecomment-668638113">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74456#issuecomment-668638113</a>), courtesy of <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="318582">@Denis Lisov</span>, which also confirms that the vast majority of the obligations produced are redundant</p>
<p>what needs to happen I suppose is some sort of deduplication of the accumulated obligations during normalization <strong>during that process</strong> as opposed to after the fact. I don't know what the best path is to do that: I don't know whether storing them all in an FxHashSet in the first place is feasible (maybe some duplicates are actually necessary? i seem to remember seeing some comments about ordering guarantees, how does that impact potential deduplication strategies? etc.) and I'm not sure what the compiler's general design philosophy requires for this to be implemented elegantly and soundly</p>
<p>so I guess at this point I'm in need of </p>
<ul>
<li>confirmation of whether my assessment of the problem is correct</li>
<li>confirmation of whether my assumption that earlier deduplication is the best (most feasible &amp; efficient) strategy as opposed to some higher-level algorithmic improvement</li>
<li>guidance on how to implement something of the sort without interfering with guarantees of which I might be unaware or causing other problems</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<p>That seems like a reasonable idea to me. I suspect you'll quickly discover if that's feasible or not when the rustc bootstrap completes or ICEs. Assuming it works, iirc, this code has been pretty heavily optimized by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="120989">@njn</span> and I think there's special handling somewhere for 0 or 1 obligations which are extremely common. So it may not be as simple as just changing this to use a <code>FxHashSet</code>, we may need some kind of hybrid data structure that avoids the hashing overhead for 1 element collections. If deduplicating along the way works, we can probably solve any performance concerns once we can run the modified compiler on the <a href="http://perf.rust-lang.org">perf.rust-lang.org</a> infrastructure.</p>

<p>definitely seems like there are some ordering guarantees, replacing a bunch of the predicate vecs with hashsets ends up giving me an "encountered ambiguity" ICE while trying to build the stage1 standard library</p>
<p>full error:</p>

<p>definitely need to talk to someone who knows what guarantees are important for these data structures</p>

<p>Just to see if it helps the issue you're running into, could you keep the sorted vector around and also a <code>FxHashSet</code> and then only append to the vector if it's not already in the hash set? I guess if the duplicates are actually needed then that won't work.</p>

<p>well, a correction to my previous note is in order. The repro crate I used to demonstrate the issue initially now builds successfully on <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="117366">@Tatsuyuki Ishi</span>'s branch and just on stable rustc, but the actual project I was working on that I was attempting to minimize with that demonstration still doesn't work (OOMs). I think it might be related to <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/70513">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/70513</a>, but unlike that issue it persists when the relevant use-site is fully annotated. It's similar in that the bug is only exercised by body checking of the function which monomorphizes the type and not any definition-site.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="125250">@Wesley Wiser</span> well, I finally have a reproduction that doesn't incorporate any external dependencies after a bit of work over the past week or so. <a href="https://github.com/syntacticsugarglider/rustc-bug-mcve">https://github.com/syntacticsugarglider/rustc-bug-mcve</a>. It compiles fine (almost instantly) if the nesting depth on this Test type is reduced: <a href="https://github.com/syntacticsugarglider/rustc-bug-mcve/blob/main/src/lib.rs#L135">https://github.com/syntacticsugarglider/rustc-bug-mcve/blob/main/src/lib.rs#L135</a> or if it's bounded on any other trait than the Unravel trait adapted from <code>protocol</code>.  I picked an arbitrary amount of nesting that will exceed system memory limits and get SIGKILL'd on every machine I have access to, but much shallower degrees of nesting are still sufficient to cause exceedingly long compilation times and use gigabytes of memory. This could definitely use further minimization, but in my cursory efforts to do so the removal of a variety of seemingly unrelated constraints (unrelated to the StreamError parameter that seems causative as mentioned below) ends up resolving the problem and causing reproduction to fail (i.e. it compiles expediently).</p>
<p>I have a bunch of notes that probably reflect  a lot of fundamental misunderstandings about how the trait solver works here, but I've found it difficult to clarify my understanding much beyond procedurally working through the control flow of the relevant bits of the compiler source as the documentation (in the compiler book etc) is pretty sparse and high-level: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYcjLCgtHrML7l0vh6wWzS_cWOb7RbAUmQV2W70cFTM/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oYcjLCgtHrML7l0vh6wWzS_cWOb7RbAUmQV2W70cFTM/edit?usp=sharing</a><br>
The more recent information is toward the end of the document, and the gist of the issue seems to be that there's an immense duplication of obligations that occurs with the variance being sp. over an inference variable that is always in the same position, that being the second type parameter of the Transport struct from protocol-mve-transport, which in the simplified reproduction is the first parameter: <a href="https://github.com/syntacticsugarglider/rustc-bug-mcve/blob/main/src/lib.rs#L137">https://github.com/syntacticsugarglider/rustc-bug-mcve/blob/main/src/lib.rs#L137</a>. This is quite reminiscent of <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/70513">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/70513</a>, but instead the problem arises during typechecking (both initially and during the second MIR typecheck) while selecting candidates for that root predicate (the : Unravel one) instead of inference. I'm also not really sure how relevant this even is to <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74456">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74456</a>, as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="117366">@Tatsuyuki Ishi</span>'s changes seem to have remedied that to a degree, the original reproduction used in that issue now compiles successfully.</p>
<p>This is reproducible on current stable, nightly, and Ishi's fork with deduplication etc. removed (<a href="https://github.com/ishitatsuyuki/rust/tree/nodup">https://github.com/ishitatsuyuki/rust/tree/nodup</a>). </p>
<p>This is long and sort of rambling and incoherent, I've collected rather a lot of information about this problem and don't have the generalized domain knowledge to put it all together so the relative lack of structure here reflects the lack of cognitive structure I've managed to apply to this issue. Let me know if any clarification is in order or if there's anything I should work on other than further minimization. Any further information, especially on why that type variable is being duplicated, would be exceedingly welcome, incl. information as to why there's an inference variable there in the first place as, as far as I can tell, everything is fully annotated &amp; specified. Moreover, I'm not sure what should happen to those two existing issues, because I'm not exactly sure what their precise relationship is to the current state of things.</p>

<p>Thanks for the excellent minimization and investigation! Unfortunately, this is well outside of my knowledge of the type checker. Perhaps <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="116009">@nikomatsakis</span> has an idea of what the next step to investigate here would be? (Or at least, who else should be looped in for questions?) </p>
<p>Having read your document, I'm also a bit confused by the naming of <code>fn vtables_impl()</code> as it doesn't seem to have anything to do with virtual function calls, just trait implementations. If my git blame is to be believed, this function was originally added a very long time ago:</p>

Date:   Thu Oct 9 17:19:50 2014 -0400

    Implement multidispatch and conditional dispatch. Because we do not
    attempt to preserve crate concatenation, this is a backwards compatible
    change.
</code></pre></div>
<p>Perhaps the name refers to a time when trait methods were always dynamically dispatched or something?</p>

<p>yeah I'm frankly not sure what's up with that call or its name, but thankfully it didn't end up being crucial to my investigation. the relevant duplication  seems to be carried over wherever those normalization-implied obligations are concerned, so any query entry-point that's involved in one of those processes is quite sufficient. for what it's worth I also have Massif and -Zself-profile data for these reproductions, but I'm not sure that's really helpful now that the hotspots are identified any the specific cause is somewhat more nailed down (the duplication over inference variables). Do let me know if they're useful, I can provide them.</p>

<p>dw, i realize that this probably isn't a priority given that it seems i'm more or less the only one who has managed to exercise the issue to any substantive degree and there's active redesign work happening on the trait solver regardless. if i had more info i would try to fix it myself given that i've been blocked on this for like 6mo, so anything is useful tbh.</p>

<p>do you know if there's a resource on the process by which inference variables are generated and resolved? that's the part I'm most confused about, and it seems the most causative: the duplication occurs over seemingly identical inference variables in position of an explicitly annotated concrete type, and it's that duplication that results in the absurd memory usage.</p>

<p>I'm currently poking at the compiler, and i notice that the <code>&lt;T as Unravel&gt;::UnravelAssoc</code> gets placed in a special <code>outlives_predicates</code> variable.</p>
<p>The comment <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/c4b90dfdc53882e139a2ca18ecc0cbadf56a1e40/compiler/rustc_trait_selection/src/traits/mod.rs#L308-L325">just above</a> also clarifies;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Inferred outlives bounds can create a lot of <code>TypeOutlives</code> predicates for associated types, so to make the situation less bad, we normalize all the predicates <em>but</em> the <code>TypeOutlives</code> predicates first inside the unnormalized parameter environment, and then we normalize the <code>TypeOutlives</code> bounds inside the normalized parameter environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm still early and green in my "how does rust work" journey, and i'm taking a metaphorical sledgehammer at trying to understand this, but i have the feeling that this is causing the implicit predicate to be excluded from optimizations, and somehow recursively/exponentially "solved" for every nesting in <code>((((),),),)...</code></p>

<p>I'm currently taking that sledgehammer further by (probably) breaking the compiler by having it not do draining to <code>outlives_predicates</code> at all, but it compiled, and it compiled that program. Now i'm just investigating the different debug outputs as i go. So far, it's not proving much of anything, so i'll have to look further.</p>

<p>I'm slowly starting to understand how subtle this bug seems to be, removing <code>outlives_predicates</code> didn't seem to do anything, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Ive narrowed it further down, i have a comparison between <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="117366">@Tatsuyuki Ishi</span>'s <a href="https://github.com/ishitatsuyuki/rust/tree/nodup">branch</a> and current latest (<code>51748a8fc77283914d4135f31b5966a407208187</code>), and while ishi's branch <em>does</em> seem to re-introduce <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/43787">#43787</a>, it also reduces this issue from it's exponential standpoint.</p>
<p>You can try the following 3 patches on <code>51748a</code> to see the performance differences, i'll explain how to apply these in a moment.</p>
<p>The first patch adds some specific verbose logging, some part of the patch provided by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="266752">@Izzy Swart</span> here, after compilation, you can see a <code>dump</code> file in the compiler's working directory to get some insight into duplicate obligations from a result of <code>normalize_with_depth_to</code>.</p>
<p>But what i'm more interested in is what error output gives after you put the environment variable <code>RUSTC_OBL_DUP=yes</code> after applying the second patch (though not onto the third), which prints if duplicate obligations are found within either the <code>NormalizedTy</code> cache, or if there'd be duplicates between the <code>NormalizedTy.obligations</code> and <code>&amp;mut obligations</code> vec, in the case of the test code, it starts to blow up the amount of duplicate obligations.</p>
<p>The third patch removes this piece of cache altogether, which brings down the performance impact.</p>
<p>First patch: <a href="/user_uploads/4715/zU-HsWrBeBk_ht-H9tBaAen1/add_logging.patch">add_logging.patch</a> </p>
<p>Second patch: <a href="/user_uploads/4715/Cu8OVHM1EwS7lWFa8TpWJUAm/obl_dump.patch">obl_dump.patch</a> </p>
<p>Third patch: <a href="/user_uploads/4715/Q5NXd2z27pBPNcXfIIy_SXwa/nocache.patch">nocache.patch</a> (effectively ishi's branch, but able to be applied onto that commit)</p>
<p>Test code: <a href="/user_uploads/4715/Ydw1jf6LSLlpnnkh8Z9PfjRr/main.rs">main.rs</a> (adjust the dots inside the <code>Test</code> macro at your discretion to get more recursion/explosion, the <code>3 GB</code> isn't accurate for that last piece anymore, remove the commented-out-three dots to make it accurate again)</p>

<p>Only allowing <code>Trait</code>-related predicates in the cache.</p>
<p>This seems to fix the issue as denoted by <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/43132#issuecomment-313933159">the minimalized code</a> (as the original code compiled fine on latest), and going further (with the same <code>src/main.rs</code> above), it seems to fix that issue as well, being able to add as many nestings as i want, and it only linearly scaling (instead of exponentially).</p>
<p>I'm wary to introduce this change, this is very hotch-potch, i do not have in-depth knowledge of the intricacies of what i'm playing with here, and I really want someone else to verify this fix before we go apply it to the codebase, because unless im <em>very</em> lucky, i don't believe this is all there was to fix (for this to work and not cause any further ICEs)</p>

<p>Poking further, <code>Projection</code> also seems to pass <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/43132">#43132</a>, however, this seems to reactivate the issue again.</p>
<p>I also tried <code>Projection(..) =&gt; None, _ =&gt; Some(o.clone())</code>, but interestingly enough, this seems to reactivate <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/43132">#43132</a> again, i'm currently trying to figure out how this happens.</p>

<p>Okay, after that last message, i went back and tested my first solution again, and... it doesn't work anymore? I think i'm either encountering a slightly-older version of my compiled <code>rustc</code> being used for the moment, or a mistype, or anything inbetween.</p>

<p>Messing around a little bit, <code>Projection(..)</code> seems to fix <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/43132">#43132</a>, but like noted above, triggers the performance issue, at this point i don't really know how to start fixing it, or on what ends i could potentially filter this better, or where to look now.</p>
<p>Thus, this issue is not fixed, sorry, i seem to have gotten faulty results.</p>

<p>did some more investigating. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="216206">@lcnr</span>'s minimization compiles on nightly w/ Ishi's patch applied while the original minimization still does not, so it unfortunately doesn't preserve reproduction. this has manifested in a variety of different confusing ways in edge-case scenarios, but fundamentally they all happen in associated type normalization and boil down to the creation of a huge stream of duplicate predicates and weird duplicate inference variables. This seems directly related to the comment made <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/0148b971c921a0831fbf3357e5936eec724e3566/compiler/rustc_trait_selection/src/traits/project.rs#L480">here</a> about issue <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/20304">#203040</a>. I'm not sure why I thought there was something else more nuanced going on here, I must have noticed this comment at some point and maybe glossed over it? Seems pretty directly relevant to the behavior I'm observing. I'd love to fix this but I don't really know what the relevant sort of "ambiguity" that's being discussed here is,  why it leads to normalizing about a dozen straightforward projections down to literally millions of obligations, etc. Maybe <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="116009">@nikomatsakis</span> can comment on this?</p>

<p>for what it's worth "seems directly related" can probably be stated a bit more strongly: it's clear from extensive profiling and investigation of a few different examples that I previously thought were different issues that they all boil down to the accumulation of these presumably-spurious duplicate obligations during the normalization process, sp. in opt_normalize_projection_type and recursion from there. this naturally comes up in selection, item wf checking, mir borrowck in one case even, but the underlying issue is the same, which in a way returns us to square one where there was one isolated issue related to the duplication of obligations.</p>

<p>No worries, thanks for taking the time to look at this problem at all :D</p>
