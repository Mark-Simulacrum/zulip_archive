<p>Hey <span class="user-group-mention" data-user-group-id="1411">@T-lang/WG-meta</span>,</p>
<p>You may have noticed there is no meeting invite for today or next week. I'm super busy today and traveling next week so I think it's best if we skip. (Also, I've almost got last week's video ready to post; I had to do some light editing.) I wouldn't mind having an "async conversation" though about the best steps forward, though. I've been pondering what we ought to create as "deliverables" and how to best structure conversation.</p>
<p>(We could discuss here or perhaps on an internals thread?)</p>
