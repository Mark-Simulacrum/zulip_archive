<p>I'm working on updating the contributor survey to include some more positively framed questions so we're not only focused on problems as documented in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/surveys/issues/182">https://github.com/rust-lang/surveys/issues/182</a> and I'm currently looking for suggestions for options to include with the following question:</p>
<p>"What are the elements of the rust-lang contribution experience that have had the greatest positive impact on your ability to contribute to and/or maintain Rust?"</p>

<p>the question is going to be a multiple choice where each choice has a rating of how relevant it has been, followed by a text field for people to write in any additional experiences that aren't covered by the suggested choices</p>

<p>so yea to reiterate why I opened this stream: Does anyone have suggestions for what choices we should provide by default with this question? Here are the options I've got currently</p>
<ul>
<li>Mentorship, outreach, or encouragement from other project members</li>
<li>Learning materials and documentation (rustc-dev-guide, forge, github readmes, API docs)</li>
<li>Contribution sprints</li>
<li>Welcoming environment with clear path to getting involved</li>

<p>Yes,  it will allow for a matrix where you select a rating of how big of an impact each of these has had for you,  from zero to large  with a follow-up question as a text field for people to fill in anything that's not listed</p>

<ul>
<li>Feeling safe and welcomed within the project</li>

<p>The last three in this list are excellent additions.  The 1st one I think is a restatement of the last item in <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="220273">@Jane Lusby [she/her]</span> 's list.  I'm not sure what the 2nd is referring to and likely wouldn't consider it as a respondent. Same for the 3rd. It's meaning is unclear to me. Can you clarify the 2nd and 3rd items in your list <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="239881">@Josh Triplett</span> ?</p>

<p>I'd like to see those two points separated; "clear path to getting involved" is <em>absolutely</em> important, but it seems separate from whether you as a person feel safe and welcome.</p>

<p>There can be a clear path to get involved that's covered in barbed wire and land mines. And you can feel safe and welcome in a project even if it isn't obvious how to start contributing to it.</p>

<p>My third point is probably somewhat close in spirit to "clear path to getting involved", and the two should probably be deduplicated.</p>
