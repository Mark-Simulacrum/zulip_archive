<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="307537">@Camelid</span> triage team currently checks for progress made on existing work done and on mentored issues, so this is not something we can do much about. But since i'm part of both groups i'll answer it one place: </p>
<p>Earlier we had a discussion in wg-prioritisation of raising the priority on issues that have been prioritised but there's no progress on them for some time period, but we decided to defer it for the future. So i don't think there's anything that either of the 2 working groups can do here other than re-prioritising the issue. Also judging by the labels, it still needs a mcve.</p>
