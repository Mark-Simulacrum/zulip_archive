<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75067">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75067</a> hasn't had activity for 2 months. unclear if it's waiting on author or review or both. the perf run is strongly negative :(</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76133">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76133</a> draft, waiting on author. I'm not sure what this is meant to do - it's missing the 'without cascading errors' part of the original issue</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75434">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75434</a> waiting on me to actually put time into it. I closed it, I don't plan on working on it.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/69167">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/69167</a> this PR is a mess and waiting for someone besides me to think about it. considering just closing it, <a href="http://docs.rs">docs.rs</a> source browsing isn't in a state to take advantage of it anyway.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/71827">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/71827</a> is waiting on review for 2 months. I switched the labels.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75615">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75615</a> is in an unknown state (maybe waiting on author?) No activity for 2 months. I don't know what Polly is, <a href="https://github.com/llvm-mirror/polly">https://github.com/llvm-mirror/polly</a> says something about a different way to represent optimizations.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76087">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76087</a> I think is waiting on author, no activity for 2 months</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76802">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76802</a> is in an unknown state and it seems to be unclear what benefit it brings:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>You'd have to compute liveness of locals, which isn't too difficult. But since this optimization had no measurable performance benefits anyways, I'm not sure that's worth it (running dataflow might slightly regress performance).</p>

<p>No activity for a month.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76570">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76570</a> is waiting on review I think. No activity for a month.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74879">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74879</a> is still stuck on figuring out on why rustdoc's cache is broken. I still think we should do <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/76382">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/76382</a> first.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77246">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77246</a> is waiting on review for a month. <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="119009">eddyb</span> is very behind on notifications, so it might make sense to assign a different reviewer. Unclear what the PR actually does.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75435">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75435</a> seems to have stalled out, no activity for 3 weeks. Unclear what the path forward is (does this need an RFC?).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76460">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76460</a> is waiting for someone in T-compiler to have an opinion for or against. IMO since no one feels strongly in the past month we should just close it.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70533">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70533</a> is waiting on author for 3 weeks. Would <em>love</em> to have this but it still needs a ton of work to finish up (and there are unresolved concerns about how to replicate the tests locally).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77162">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77162</a> is waiting on author for a month</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77051">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77051</a> is waiting on author for 3 weeks. Would love to have this change but not sure how much work it still needs.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77271">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77271</a> - marked as experiment, ignoring.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77376">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77376</a> still waiting on me to decide whether the risk is worth the benefit.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77268">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77268</a> was ready to go, I approved it</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76426">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76426</a> is waiting on author for 2 months. It will probably be easier to open a new PR than rebase this one, so I'm inclined to close it</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73530">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73530</a> is blocked on T-core (<a href="#narrow/stream/231349-t-core.2Flicensing/topic/license.20fields.20to.20all.20rustc.20crates">https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/231349-t-core.2Flicensing/topic/license.20fields.20to.20all.20rustc.20crates</a>)</li>
