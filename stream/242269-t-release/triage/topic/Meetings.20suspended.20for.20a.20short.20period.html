<p>Hey <span class="user-group-mention" data-user-group-id="3132">@WG-triage</span>, sadly we couldn't have the meetings for August and September as planned. Due to irl reasons, I can't commit to being available at a certain time and we also don't have much to discuss at the moment. </p>
<p>In that case I won't be hosting the meeting for next few months. If anyone wishes to lead a meeting you can feel free to do so just ensure you inform the group. </p>
<p>Thanks and stay safe</p>
