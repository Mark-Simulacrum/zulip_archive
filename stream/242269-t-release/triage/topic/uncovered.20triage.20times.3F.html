<p>I fell off the map for a while but I find myself in a position where I could devote an hour a week to triage. What days are currently uncovered?</p>

<p>We don't have much triage going on, so probably any day except Sunday (when <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="260190">John Simon</span> does a lot of triage) would be fine. My day is Thursday but I don't think sticking to days is as important right now.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256342">@bstrie</span> don't worry about stepping on anyone's toes at this point. There are more than enough PRs to triage, and the effort could use all the help it can get, especially after the holiday break. :)</p>

<p>yeah the schedule is a bit messed up right now so you can look at the reports and pick up the day where no triage happens</p>
