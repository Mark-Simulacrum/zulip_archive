<p>Just FYI/Discussion...</p>
<p>I got a message from rustbot today:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Ping from triage:
@cehteh can you please address the comments and set S-waiting-on-review when you&#39;re done? Thank you.
</code></pre></div>

<p>This left me a bit puzzled about how to do this. I known that 'labels' are a github feature, but i didn't seen any UI for changing those. Searching for 'github set label' was not really helpful either. Thus I just asked on the PR how to handle this. Thankfully some kind soul (thanks hkratz) gave me the hint (and by that did this for me):</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code> Like this:
@rustbot label -S-waiting-on-author +S-waiting-on-review

(rustbot documentation)
</code></pre></div>

<p>Instead it would be nice when rustbot could give such an hint in the first place:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Ping from triage:
@cehteh can you please address the comments then reply with &#39;@rustbot label -S-waiting-on-author +S-waiting-on-review&#39;
</code></pre></div>

<p>Looks to me like some very simple change which would make contribution a lot simpler (and bind less human resources, petting noobs like me).</p>
<p>Furthermore, a bit more complicated: How about a '@rustbot done' command, which just scans what it requested most recently from the user and then applies that (Of course rustbots helpful hint should then include '... or reply with @rustbot done).</p>

<p><code>@rustbot</code> does not send messages like that. Those messages are sent by human triagers. That said, I think we could try to include a mention of <code>@rustbot ready</code> in our messages.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="330154">@The 8472</span>   sorry I didn't realize that that people not in the "The Rust Programming Language" group had limits on which tags could be set on github.  Please ignore that. Thanks</p>

<p>I didn't even know that this was a message from a human, was thinking that it was an automated reminder done by triage. Nevermind then.<br>
Still I think it would be nice that for such basics things one doesn't need to read a tons of docs, there is some information overflow. Nevertheless I do like that everything is nicely documented in rust, just with that much docs, discoverability becomes a problem.</p>
