<p>Hey folks. I'm not sure if this group will find this useful, but I've been working on a GitHub issue triage tool that might be helpful: <a href="https://github.com/rylev/triage-tracker">https://github.com/rylev/triage-tracker</a></p>
<p>I just added support for seeing stale issues (i.e., issues that have not been commented on) since a given date. For example,<br>
<code>triage-tracker triaged A-diagnostics --since 2020-07-01</code> finds all issues labeled with <code>A-diagnostics</code> that have not been commented on since at least last July 1st. If you don't provide a date it defaults to 1 year in the past. </p>
<p>There's also functionality for seeing what the net issue closure is for a given time span. For instance <code>triage-tracker closings range -s 2021-06-07 -e 2021-05-31</code> will tell you the difference in issue (re)openings vs issue closures. Ideally this number is always negative so that we're closing more issues than are opened. </p>
<p>Let me know if anyone finds this potentially useful. There's lots we could do with it including hooking it up to a bot that informs us when issues have become stale.</p>

<p>If you try it out locally, do note that it is fairly aggressive with the GitHub API so you're likely to quickly run into rate limiting issues.</p>

<p>If anyone is interested in which issues labeled with A-diagnostics have not been triaged in over a year, here it is: <a href="https://gist.github.com/rylev/5c4db4ff868dee9b7776a1f7e77a6e30">https://gist.github.com/rylev/5c4db4ff868dee9b7776a1f7e77a6e30</a>. The list has 505, but I think I missed a few due to rate limiting issues.</p>

<p>this looks good, I wonder if it's possible to do it with PRs as well? that would be really handy. Thanks</p>

<p>github treats PRs as issues so I would be surprised if it isn't supported already</p>

<p>Yes PRs should be somewhat supported, but I can add direct support for PRs (so that you get only information about PRs and not plain issues)</p>

<p>One other issue is that currently, only comments are used as a way of determining if an issue is stale. For pull requests, reviewing the code and leaving comments on code (which GitHub does not classify as a comment) also needs to be taken into consideration.</p>
