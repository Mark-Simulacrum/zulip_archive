<p>(I am still learning about compiler team processes, so please let me know if there's a better place for this, etc.)</p>
<p>One of my PRs (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/79757">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/79757</a>) has had an initial round of review about 1 month ago, but since then things have gone quiet. Maybe this is expected with holidays and such? I noticed the reviewer seems to have a large queue of reviews... Would it make sense for someone else to take a look? It's not urgent, but I am just curious whether I should keep waiting or what... I know we're all quite busy, so again just trying to learn what's appropriate here. Thanks! <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>
