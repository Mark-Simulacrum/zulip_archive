<p>Where can I help?  Its been a while since I've been involved in WG-CLI due to life but my company is giving me time to contribute to the Rust community and I want to take advantage of it to see clap3 released.</p>
<p>I've been digging into the pinned issues and its not quite clear what the next steps are</p>
<ul>
<li>There are some <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/2164">renames</a>.  How decided are we on these?  For any place with question marks, what is the process for deciding?  Should I just make a decision and create a PR to discuss it there?</li>
<li>For <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/1104">enums</a>, there was a blog post on this being implemented a long time ago, so I'm unsure where this is at now</li>
<li>For <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/1041">lifetimes</a>, it seems we are now down to just <code>'help</code> which sounds like was the goal.  I did mention in it that <code>kstring</code> is an alternative.</li>
<li>For <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/950">lib blitz</a>, there aren't any problems identified.  Are we still needing to do the audit and open  issues?</li>
<li>For <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/1661">custom derive</a>, it looks like this is pre-structopt.  How much is still relevant?</li>
<li>For <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/1037">the rest of the 3.x tracking issue</a>, there aren't associated tasks and its unclear what is expected.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="424212">@Ed Page</span> Thanks, I am looking forward to your help. I am treating the <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/milestone/76">3.0 milestone</a> as the single source of truth for all the remaining work in clap. The 3.x tracking issue was the original roadmap which I want to tick stuff off too so that I didn't miss anything.</p>
<p>I was in the middle of fixing "Remove inherent global settings" which is last item that needs to be done from the <code>beta</code> milestone of that tracking issue. But then, I realised that I needed to do a settings audit and gotten bogged down in it.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>For <code>lifetimes</code>, after our recent conversation I have moved it <code>4.0</code>. I would definitely love to give it a try and see what happens just before releasing 3.0 but to be honest, I feel like it's low priority.</li>
<li>For <code>lib blitz</code>, we still need to do an audit and I want to do it after all the feature work has been done</li>
<li>For <code>custom derive</code>, the issue is open because we don't have docs for those derives yet. All the feature work has been done. (There are quite a few other issues which deal purely with documentation and I definitely planned to tackle these after the settings audit).</li>
<li>For <code>enums</code>, I honestly don't have much context about that issue and will need to talk to Kevin to understand what his original intentions were. Which is why I was holding it for to be the last of the feature work.</li>
<li>For <code>renames</code>, feel free to write a comment there proposing any renames you would like. <code>?</code> means I haven't come up with a good name yet. I will be extending that list as part of my settings audit. I created that issue because I wanted people to discuss them and propose alternatives if they want to.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/2005">enum subcommand</a> is the next issue I wanted to tackle after the current work. I am not completely happy with the design proposed in that issue, so feel free to come up with a better design. Once that is done, I wanted to tackle <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/1772">vec types in derive</a> which is a very interesting feature to work on.</p>
<p>I would greatly appreciate if you could spearhead those 2 issues. What do you think?</p>

<p>Sure! I'll start tackling them tomorrow!  Feel free to assign them to me.</p>
<p>I didn't look for the milestone because of the pinned issues.  Maybe we should unpin them and/or have the 3.x tracking issue link out to the 3.0 milestone?</p>
