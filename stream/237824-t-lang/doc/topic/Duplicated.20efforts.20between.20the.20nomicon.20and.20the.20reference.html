<p>as described in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/nomicon/issues/230">https://github.com/rust-lang/nomicon/issues/230</a>, the nomicon and the reference have some similar chapters currently. While updating the sections, I'm not sure if we should update them each other or should add a "for more details" link to a shorter one. Any thoughts on this?</p>

<p>I would probably defer the list of rules (like the coercions and casts) to the reference, and keep the nomicon focused on the discussion of how to use those effectively and what the implications can be.  </p>
<p>In theory that information could be duplicated, but given our limited resources, I think it is very easy for them to go out of sync.</p>

<p>re lifetimes, it looks like the nomicon incorporated some of the NLL changes before they became stable? and the reference never finished updating for that?</p>

<p>Yea, the reference doesn't have much of anything for lifetimes (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/reference/issues/290">https://github.com/rust-lang/reference/issues/290</a>).</p>
