<p>Hi, so this summer I have a few personal events to organize and that will take most of my time. So there are definitely weeks where I'll not be responsive at all. I would not want to block potential contributions of other people that will instead have more free time this summer. So I think we should cut 0.2.1 now so that the release branch is in a nice state for people that might use it as a base for experiments on current limitations. We can leave PRs 94 and 95 for later. Maybe merge 92 (history &amp; memory unification) if you think it's worth it and you have some time to focus on reviewing that.</p>

<p>Equally importantly, when I have some time in the coming weeks I want to add a section to the guide detailing all the current limitations of 0.2 API. It would contain explanations for most on the issues discussed in the "advanced_dependency_providers" repo, as well as a detailed explanation of why handling pre-release versions is extra difficult. I feel like having all that explained as clearly as I can will improve our chances of finding a good solution to those limitations, either us or someone else.</p>

<p>You should take time for yourself, as much as you need!<br>
I will try to get time to revue <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/92">#92</a>, this weekend. I am having some computer troubles, but I will try.<br>
I am Ok with cutting a <code>0.2.1</code> when every you want. If we get more compatible work, we can always do a <code>0.2.2</code>.<br>
The more you want to add to the guide the better! It is really good work.</p>
