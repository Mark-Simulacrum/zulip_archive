<p>Hey, we've just started lock down again in France, and being at home, I've spent a little too much time on this since last Thursday. I'll try taking a time off pubgrub until end of week. Next week I've taken some holiday so I'll be more available without remorse if I can focus this week on work thing ^^.</p>

<p>Take your time! I was also much less available as you may have noticed due to a week of 24/7 support I went through last week, and the next one is going to be that again.<br>
I'll recover in a couple of days and will do the reviews and try to wrap up my own PRs.</p>

<p>I have been hiding from politics ( both national and workplace ) by working on this. Thank you both for reminding me to pace myself. And try not to let my obsession with this project push you into working on it more than is healthy for you.</p>
